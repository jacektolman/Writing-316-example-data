  Hello, I am so sorry your daycare closed down, seems like a lot are closing
  down and quickly.
  I have 1 spot that came available to start as early as 10/14. I’m open from
  7:30-5:30 and provide all food and milk with lunch. Nap time is between
  12-3pm. Drop off is between 7:30-9am and pick ups are between 3-5:30pm. We do
  many activities in the morning and even go to the park that’s next door while
  our back yard is getting new fencing and grass. I do have dogs but they don’t
  interact with the kids (Basset Hounds sleep all day) and my old cats just stay
  away.
  The kids have cubbies that hold extra clothes, diapers and their nap blanket.
  I’ll let you know when I need anything with plenty of notice. I do help with
  potty training as long as parents have started at home first.
  How did you hear about my daycare?

 to pay a withdrawal fee equivalent for those 30 days’ tuition, without any prorated refund given. When a student
 terminates his/her attendance, all unpaid tuition, fees and other school charges become immediately due and

  Carden Conservatory Preschool
  Potty Training Success
  Applying the Carden Philosophy to Potty Training
 Philosophy
 
 Each child is a unique individual. A successful program is sensitive to the child’s social,
 emotional, and physical needs. Our developmentally appropriate potty training program
 focuses on the individual needs of your family, helping you and your child enjoy a
 successful experience in an encouraging and nurturing environment.
 
 The Child’s Approach
 
 “The Child has eyes that see, and ears that hear. He has experiences and reaches
 conclusions” … “For a long time his achievement is fragmentary. The teacher (and the
 parent) must accept the child’s approach (and the child’s pace).”
  Excerpted from: Quality Teaching, Successful Learning, Mae Carden
 
  As true as these words are for academic learning, so are they for potty training.
 Make sure that the child sees and hears positive, encouraging words about going on the
 potty. Let him see the restroom, the Big Kid pants, and the joys of being diaper free.
 Remember that for some this can be a long term goal, for others it may happen quickly.
 
 Thinking From the Inside Out
 
  - Be responsive to effort and individual expression
  - Know when to praise, too much is cloying. Do not over praise or underestimate.
  - Maintain sure growth as the goal
  - Be a participant in the process.
 Excerpted from: Quality Teaching, Successful Learning, Mae Carden
 
  Purpose
 
  The purpose of potty training is to the child to gain control of his/her body’s
  functions. It is a time of great success and achievement. Mastering this new skill will
  help build your child’s self-esteem and enhance his positive self image.
  “Is it time to give up the diapers?”
  Children at this age are so in need of control that if a child senses that using the potty
  is something that you are choosing for him, then it gives them a focus to rebel against.
  Potty training must at least give the appearance of being the child’s choice. This
  means that parents must wait until the child is willing to “ditch” the diapers.
 
  Signs of Readiness
  o Does your child stay dry at least two hours a day?
 
  o Is your child’s bowel movement regular and predictable?
 
  o Does your child let you know with words of gestures that they
  are about to urinate or have a bowel movement?
 
  o Does your child ask to use the potty?
 
  Procedure
 Carden takes a self-mastery approach to potty training. Implementing this program
 requires that children be ready to willingly participate in the process. Willingness and
 readiness on the part of the child are necessary to create a positive experience. Only if
 the child finds the experience pleasing will it be successful for the family.
 
  1. The first step is knowledge. Exposing your child to the idea of toilets and their
  functions eliminates uncertainty.
  2. The second step is encouragement. Encourage the child’s natural interest in the
  potty and its use.
  3. The third step is security. Let your child know that he is loved wherever and
  whenever he chooses to go on the potty, and even if he does not choose to do so.
  4. The fourth step is opportunity. Take your child to the potty and offer the chance
  to go regularly.
  5. The fifth step is reinforcement. Whether the child succeeds on the potty or not,
  his effort should be rewarded.
 
 Our staff will work with each family to develop a plan that offers opportunity and
 reinforcement which is consistent and manageable both at home and school.
 Each plan will be designed to offer an incentive that interests the child and is acceptable
 to the parent. The consistency of the plan between home and school is essential to
 success. The child should realize that both his parents and his teachers support and
 encourage his efforts. A daily recognition by the parents of the child’s efforts during the
 school day is integral to success, as is recognition by the teacher of the child’s ongoing
 effort at home. We must all work together to create a consistent, positive plan for the
 child’s effort to be successful.
 
 Presenting the Opportunity
 Children will be escorted to the restroom in groups every hour and a half. ( 7:30, 9:00,
 10:30, 12:00, 3:00, 4:30, 6:00) Each child will be asked if he needs or would like to go
 on the potty. Children will be encouraged, but not forced to go on the potty. Visiting the
 restroom and seeing their peers using the facilities will encourage the children to try in
 their own time.
 
 Children will be given positive feedback, verbal and non-verbal. They will receive
 encouragement for each success, but no criticism. Children who do not “go” on the potty
 should not be made to feel that they have failed, but encouraged to seek the next
 opportunity for success. Your child will proudly present to you his/her daily Potty
 Training Chart for your encouraging words.
 
 Reinforcing the Idea
 Each family will be encouraged to carefully consider the type of reinforcement that they
 choose. Each child will respond best to rewards that are of interest to him. If your child
 is fond of insects, bug stickers might be best for your daily chart. If she loves flowers, a
 flower stamp might be best for you. Remember, the most vital encouragement and
 reinforcement that your child needs is praise and a smile from his/her loved ones as you
 discuss the Potty Training Chart he shows you each day.
 
  Suggestions for Reinforcements
  a. Stickers
  b. Stamps
  c. Treasure Chest Items
  d. Choosing a story
  e. Being Line Leader
 
 How can Parents and Teachers help children feel competent as they master this skill?
 
  o By offering modified toilet seats secured to the adult-size seats
 
  o By insuring that someone is available to assist any needs the child
  may have
  o By providing step stools to make sinks and paper towels accessible
 
 Carden will work hand in hand with the parents to ensure your child’s success in potty
 training. Our staff is available to discuss any concerns that you may have concerning
 your child’s progress. Our goal is to provide a safe and nurturing environment that will
 help your child to be successful in the potty training process. Each child will receive
 immediate positive reinforcement for every attempt the child makes through a sticker
 chart that will help to outline the child’s progress. Parents are encouraged to discuss and
 praise their child each day for the progress your child has made. Together, we can make
 the potty training experience positive and rewarding for the child.

  Carden Conservatory
  Uniform Information
 
 Carden Conservatory is proud of its uniform policy. We believe that a student’s
 appearance has a direct impact on his or her attitude, behavior, and academic
 performance at school. Uniforms foster school pride and are praised as a
 convenience by our parents. Uniforms also instill a sense of modesty and decorum
 and help students to realize that there is an appropriate dress for the proper time
 and place. Uniforms also serve to reduce distractions from the real purpose of
 school, which is to learn, not make fashion comparisons. This uniform policy is
 designed to free children to appreciate the deeper qualities of their classmates.
 Because children’s attention is not as focused on superficial, surface differences,
 there is greater acceptance among peers and discourages “cliquish” behavior.
 
 Monday and certain assembly days are our Official Carden Uniform Days. On all
 other days our optional uniforms may be worn. Students are required to wear their
 Carden Conservatory maroon shirts on Fridays and field trip days. Sandals and
 backless shoes are not permitted. Children in grades 5th-8th are required to dress
 out for P.E.
 
 All uniforms are available through Vicki Marsha Uniforms.

 Island Village Montessori School’s 12 Acre campus is home to over 500 children
 in grades Pre-K - 8th.
 
 Our Charter program is part of the Sarasota County School District
 serving students in Kindergarten – 8^th grade, and is the county’s only FREE
 Montessori Charter School.
 
 Our private, tuition based, preschool program is open to children ages 3-5.
 Tuition information is found on our website by visiting
 www.IslandVillage.org/earlychildhood
 
 As is customary with Montessori learning environments our preschool program
 hosts students in a variety of ages. IVMS preschool children are
 typically ranging in ages from early 3 – 5yrs old. All children must be fully
 potty trained before attending IVMS.
 
 Students enjoy an open concept classroom with a variety of workspaces,
 Montessori learning materials and three opportunities a day to play outdoors.
 Lessons focus on academics as well as social and emotional learning. The variety
 of ages and abilities allows for collaborative learning and the flexibility to
 meet each child where they are at individually while encouraging their growth.
 The goal is to prepare them not just to be a student but to also be a joyful
 learner.
 
 We would love to have an opportunity to show you our campus and answer specific
 questions you may have. I am offering tours every Tuesday morning at 9am and
 the first Friday of each month at 4pm. Please let me know if you would like to
 join an upcoming tour!

199b701cdaafc458,"Hi REMOVED! Hi REMOVED!
 Thanks for reaching out.
 I have a spot open-I’ve been waiting for someone around the same age as the
 others to ensure cohesiveness in our day, and that everyone gets the attention
 they need and deserve.
 Currently enrolled are two, 2s and one 3 year old so honestly, could be a
 perfect fit.
 I’m happy to speak whenever is convenient for you.
 I have run in to three items that have been dealbreakers for others so I’ll
 share them with you and if you’re “good” with them, I’ll look forward to hearing
 from you.
 1. I close at noon on Fridays. (Monday - Thursday hours are 8a-5p)
 2. I have a dog (Pittie/Lab mix) who is amazing with the littles but not so
 well mannered when people come in/out the door so I usually separate her during
 drop-off and pick up time.
 3. Tuition is $1680/month.
 TinyTown is a wonderful small and nurturing environment. We focus on building
 strong friendship bonds, language & literacy, social and emotional skills and
 making sure they are ready for the next step in their adventure (a center-like
 program or Kindergarten). I work with various curriculum to ensure all
 developmental guidelines are met. And I adjust to the individual interests of
 each chil; we are a learn-through play environment - I know some families look
  for a more of an academic focus so I like to be upfront about that too. I
 subscribe to the philosophy that “play IS a child’s work”. We are cozy - like
 an extension of home. We dance, sing, shake our silliest out all day long. We
 create process art masterpieces, engage in lots of sensory and dramatic play and
 as much outdoor time as weather permits.
 Oops. I rambled. Sorry about that; it happens sometime a when I share my
 passion about TinyTown and the little people that make it wonderful.
 Soooo. If this sits well with you, I’ll look forward to a conversation.
 Can’t wait to hear about your little one and what you are wanting from the place
 your little one spends so much of his/her time.
 Happy day!

199c3f66b9fb8c68,"Hi!
 Thank you for your interest in First Baptist Pre-school!
 Currently, our three-year-old classes are fully enrolled, and we do not have any
 spots for new students.
 Registration for the 2026-2027 school year will begin in mid-January. We will
 put a banner in the front yard of the church at that time to serve as a notice
 that registration is open.
 In January, when registration opens, registration forms will be available in
 the church office and we ask for a $75.00 registration fee to reserve the spot
 in a class.
 We offer classes for three year olds, four year olds, and Kindergarten. The
 student has to be of age of the class by Sept. 1, as well as, fully potty
 trained.
 We offer two days a week for our three year olds, $150/month, either a
 Monday/Wednesday or a Tuesday/ Thursday. For our four year old classes, we offer
 3 days a week, $170/month or M-F $190/month.
 Our Kindergarten classes go M-F for $200/month.
 This is a lot of information but I hope it helps.
 We are currently on Fall Break, but would love to answer any other questions you
 have.
 Warmly,
 Georgianna Robinson

  Hello,
 
  I realize this is short notice. I should have done this earlier, but I just
  forgot. We are looking for childcare options for our three year old. When
  might a spot open up? Also, can we schedule an appointment with you to
  discuss?
 
  My REMOVED REMOVED and I look forward to hearing from you.

199ba2283d4ec7be,"Hi REMOVED,
 Thanks for reaching out! I am so sorry to hear that your daycare closed
 unexpectedly.
 We do not currently have any spots available for the 2025-26 school year.
 However, we do maintain a waitlist and we encourage you to submit an enrollment
 request through our website. There is a $50 administrative fee that secures your
 place on our waitlist. If you plan to utilize an EEC Voucher to attend Giving
 Tree, please let us know and we can waive the waitlist fee. We contact families
 immediately when spots become available. You can complete your request here:
 www.givingtreeschool.org/enrollment
 Our waitlist is first-come, first-serve, so this is a great time to get on the
 list for the 2026-27 school year. Our summer 2026 program is open to all
 children 2.9 and up, and registration opens to the public on our website in
 February. Enrollment is week by week to accommodate families’ summer schedules.
 Our summer notification sign up list (and after February 2026, summer
 registration) is on our website: www.givingtreeschool.org/summer
 If you are interested, we will be hosting an informal visit for prospective
 parents this Thursday at 4:15PM. If you can’t make it this week but are
 interested in attending a tour, we host them about monthly in the fall and with
 more regularity in the spring.
 Please don't hesitate to reach out with any questions—we look forward to the
 possibility of meeting you and your family!
 Best,
 Emery

 We actually have space for a three-year-old. Many of our students who started as
 infants recently transitioned to public schools, given the availability for new
 children.
 Tours are scheduled from 7 to 10 AM Monday through Thursday. But I have
 conducted tours earlier.

 Personal information:
 Owner/Operator:
 My name is Jennifer Houston; I have enjoyed being a licensed family child care provider
 through the state of Massachusetts and the Department of Early Education & Care
 (EEC) since August of 1996. After 13 years as a travel agent that included 8 years in
 corporate management, came the birth of my third child. After Jake was born I wanted
 to be home with my children. Along with my love of children and the need for an income,
 becoming a child care provider seemed the perfect option. My REMOVED has been a
 Waltham Firefighter since November of 1994 and our family grew to 4 children. Jesse
 was born in 1991, Ayme in 1994, Jake in 1996 and Tessa in 1999. What a wonderful
 and rewarding job this has turned out to be.
 My work began as a contracted provider for Newton Family Day Care System in
 October of 1996 where I worked with a diverse group of families. I began work as an
 independent provider in April of 2007. Myself and both of my assistants are certified in
 child CPR and First Aid. Our journey in education as childcare providers continues
 through workshops and child development training that are a requirement for our state
 license. Palissa, Debbie and I make a great team. The loving and nurturing care we
 provide has made our family childcare home a continued success. It is our absolute
 privilege and pleasure to care for your children.
 
 Certified Lead Assistant:
 Debra Close
 Hello, my name is Debra Close. I grew up in West Newton until marriage. We then
 moved to Waltham right on the West Newton line and started my own family child care
 business in 1983. I have 2 adult children Nicole & Kellie and 2 grandchildren Colt and
 Rivi. I began my own child care business so that I could be home and raise my 2 girls
 and have an income. I began my work as part of a daycare system out of West Newton
 and worked through them for 33 years. The last 12 years I was an independent
 provider for a small family child care home: up to 6 children. I retired from my own
 daycare during the pandemic but was still not ready to stop working with children. I met
 Jennifer when we both worked for the daycare system so I have known her since she
 began in 1996. I started working with Jennifer as a lead assistant when child care
 reopened after the pandemic. I absolutely love working here! My whole life I have
 worked with children, even as a teenager. It is my absolute passion. I am very grateful
 to still be working doing what I love! I am not sure yet when I will really retire, right now
 I am content and delighted to be working here 2 - 3 days a week. Who knows, maybe I
 will still be here with my walker some day!
 
 Certified assistant:
 Donna McMahon
 My name is Donna McMahon, I have been married for 42 years. I am a mother of 3 sons, Chad,
 Chris , Colby and I have 1 grandson Lincol. I have lived in Needham for the past 35 years and
 have worked as Chairwoman for the Health & Safety Committee for 8 years on a volunteer
 basis, for the renovations of the Needham High School. Most of my life has been spent working
 with children either at schools, babysitting, sports and many other events. I recently retired from
 Home Depot Corporate Division as our jobs were eliminated during the Covid emergency. Since
 my retirement I decided to look in the area of Child Care as this has been my passion. I began
 working with Jenn Houston in October of 2022. I work anywhere between 25-35 hours per
 week job sharing with Debbie Close. Jenn runs an excellent program and it shows not only
 through her daily interactions with the children but how excited they are to come everyday.
 
 My Philosophy/My Promise:
 I strive to enhance the emotional and physical wellbeing of each and every child. I
 promise to provide a safe, comfortable, nurturing, stimulating, fun and educational
 environment in my home with a semi-structured day plan. Activities will include free
 playtime, structured playtime, large motor skill playtime, small motor skills activities,
 story time, creative play, arts and crafts, music and dance activities, nature and ecology
 awareness, nutrition, cultural activities, and other educational yet fun activities. I will
 also provide nutritious meals and snacks, and encourage good personal hygiene skills
 and manners.
 Television is occasionally used during regular care hours and then only to watch
 programs that are musical or educationally oriented and appropriate for even the
 youngest viewers. I reserve the very limited use (1/ 2 hour at the most) of television for
 those days of extreme weather when outside activities are prohibited.
 My philosophy in teaching is geared towards social readiness. Through a mixture of
 guided and undirected creative play, children in my care will have the opportunity to
 learn about color, shapes, textures, numbers, letters, animals, seasons, feelings,
 senses, nutrition, personal hygiene, manners, basic science and math concepts, and
 creative concepts such as ""pretend"" play, art, music, drama, dance, independence,
 kindness and respect of one another. These may sound like lofty goals for infants,
 toddlers, and preschoolers, but most children learn all of these things and more through
 creative educational play. I do not believe in pushing any child to learn at an accelerated
 rate, and will not make a child feel pressured to achieve developmental milestones. By
 providing a fun and safe environment, I believe the children will learn at their own
 appropriate pace.
 
 1. HOUSTON FAMILY CHILD CARE.
 Houston Family Child Care is a family child care home licensed under the
 Massachusetts Department of Early Education and Care (EEC). For this purpose, “child
 care” means care for children who are in need of personal services, supervision,
 age-appropriate activities and education. I accept children aged from 4 weeks through 3
 years of age or until they move on to preschool.
 I,__________________________________ (name), Parent/Guardian (circle one) of
 _______________________________ (child’s name), agree to comply with the
 following rules and regulations of Houston Family Child Care Home beginning on
 August 25th 2025 and ending on or about June 26th 2026. (Transition schedule will

 Contracted hours may begin between the hours of 7a and 8am and end between
 the hours of 3 and 4pm.
 The total hours per week must be rounded up to the half or
 full hour. I do not offer a part time daily schedule; I will however consider a part time
 weekly schedule of a minimum of 3 full days with the minimum of 21 hours.
 
 B. SUMMER HOURS/SCHEDULE 2026
  The school year ends Friday June 26th 2026 at 12 noon. No lunch will be served
 on this day.
 If you have a child moving on to preschool during this time period you may
 choose to end your contract with me. You may also choose to send your child
 during the transitioning weeks in August of 2026 to begin some consistency in
 their schedule.
 
 4. FEES FOR 2025/26 All checks should be made payable to Jennifer
 Houston.
 Full time: Care contracted for 30 or more hours per week at the rate of $13.00 per hour
 on a set scheduled time slot. Part time: Care contracted for less than 30 hours per week
 at the rate of $15.00 per hour on a set scheduled time slot. No refunds are given due to
 late arrivals, early departures, parent vacations or child illness. Late arrivals do not
 constitute late departures. *A two week non refundable deposit is due upon signing this
 contract per child and each subsequent contract/s per new year.
 
 Full time care: $_______ per week
 Part time care: $_______ per week
 Deposit = weekly rate x 2: ________________ (Paid at the time of enrollment –

 7. ARRIVALS AND DEPARTURES.
 There is a sign in/out sheet that is used for attendance. Please send your child
 dressed for the day (weather appropriate) and adhere to your contracted arrival and
 departure times. I cannot stress this enough, please arrive on time for pick up and drop
 off. A text advising me that you are late is courteous and polite; however, it still does not
 excuse the fact that you are late.
 Late arrivals are disruptive to our daily schedule. If you need to make an
 appointment for your child you must do so that our day is not interrupted. All
 appointments must be made with every effort so that your child is picked up directly
 after lunch by 12:15 or after a nap by 2:40 at the earliest. Once a child has been picked
 up they may not return for the day. Absolutely no pick up will be allowed between the
 hours of 12:15-2:40 unless it is an emergency. This is nap time. It is disruptive to the
 entire group for us to wake a child during these hours. Please make goodbyes brief (no
 more than a couple of minutes) the longer you prolong departure the harder it is for your
 child. Please do not “sneak out”, never leave without telling your child goodbye.
 Transitions can be very stressful for any child and or parent. Some days may be easy
 while others may be more difficult, it is extremely important to keep these transactions
 brief especially on the more difficult days.
 
 8. ABSENCE POLICY. Full fee will be charged for all absences due to illness,
 early departure or parent vacation. Please make a phone call or text me to advise if a
 child will be absent each day. Any closings required by the State of Massachusetts
 and/or the CDC for COVID or any new/unknown viruses will be charged as a contracted
 day.
 
 9. CHILD ILLNESS POLICY. Provider reserves the right not to provide care
 for a child who has an acute illness or whose condition, in the Provider’s objective
 judgment, poses a direct threat to the health and safety of that child or other children or
 staff in the program. Please do not bring your child if he/she is sick; I can only care for
 
 children with mild cold-like symptoms (clear runny nose, slight cough, and no fever). Per
 Health Department regulations children will not be allowed to attend the daycare if they
 exhibit symptoms such as:
 *Rash *Fever (100 F. higher) *Excessive cold and/or cough (yellow or green mucus
 uncontrolled cough) *Vomiting *Diarrhea *Lice or nits *Pink eye or conjunctivitis (must
 be on medication for a full 24 hours) *Coxsackie virus *Unusual drowsiness *Persistent
 or excessive crying *Communicable diseases (chicken pox, Rosella, conjunctivitis,
 mumps, measles, strep throat and influenza). A child must be fever free for a full 24
 hours (without medication) before returning to daycare. If it is determined that we have a
 Norovirus or stomach flu making its way through the daycare your child must remain
 home for a minimum of 72 hours before returning to daycare as long as they are
 symptom free. If a child does become ill during daycare hours - parents will be
 contacted and the child should be removed as soon as possible. Once the child is
 removed from daycare due to illness, they may not return until after the required
 minimum hours home or until they are no longer ill.
 If a child is sent home due to illness, this will be considered an absence in accordance
 with paragraph 8.
 In addition, if a child is on an antibiotic for the very first time they may not return
 to daycare until they have been administered 3 full doses of that medication.
 
 10. MEDICATION: Provider can administer medication if needed, but only if the
 Medication Consent Form has been signed. All medicine must be in the original
 container with the child's name clearly written on it. Written instructions with the child's
 name, dose and times need to accompany the medication. I cannot administer any over
 the counter medicine during daycare hours. This includes but is not limited to: Tylenol,
 Children’s Motrin, Baby Aspirin or Cold Medication. If your child needs any of these
 medications they should NOT be in daycare.
 
 11. MEDICAL EMERGENCIES: In the case of a serious accident or
 sudden illness requiring medical attention, the following procedures are followed:
 1) Immediate medical attention is given: CPR or FIRST AID
 2) A phone call is made to 911.
 2) Child's parents (or emergency contacts) are called.
 3) Child and health records are taken to emergency service at Newton Wellesley
 Hospital or Hospital of choice.
 4) In all cases, an emergency report is completed and a copy is given to parents as well
 as the EEC.
 * It is extremely important, especially in instances of illness or emergency that the
 emergency contact information is up to date and all information is correct. Please report
 any changes immediately to keep your emergency contact information current.
 * For minor injuries like bumps and bruises, I will provide home first aid. If the injury is
 more serious, (I.e. needs stitches, broken bones, or dislocation, etc.) the parent will be
 notified immediately. Parents will be responsible for all costs involved in emergency
 medical treatment, including emergency transportation if required.
 
 12. SAFE ENVIRONMENT: Providers home is child-proofed by accordance
 with ECC license. I do not have any stairs. Poisons and medicines are stored in locked
 cabinets or out of reach of children. I have a carbon monoxide detector and several
 smoke detectors throughout the house. All electrical outlets are capped when not in
 use.
 
 12. ANIMAL HEALTH: I have 2 dogs; Skye a lab/shar pei mix & Odis is a treeing
 walker coon hound. Skye is a very shy dog and although she is great around the
 children she does not like to be touched or approached. Children are taught from the
 start not to touch the dogs. In general the dogs are asked to leave any space that we
 may currently be occupying. Parents: Please just ignore the dogs if they should be in
 our space at drop off or pick up, I do this so that my dogs learn not to approach any new
 people. All dogs are current with their vaccines.
 
 13. WITHDRAWAL OF CHILD BY PARENT. At the end of a (4)
 week trial period, DATE BEING _____________________, parent may terminate this
 contract after a discussion that leads us to a mutual agreement that your child is not
 adjusting to his/her surroundings and we agree that it is for the best interest of your
 child. After the above date a 1 month (4 week) advance notice in writing is required for
 termination from parents. If after the one month advance notice is given and a payment
 has been made for more than 4 weeks a refund will be given for those remaining days
 after 4 weeks (in cases of 5 weeks in a month). There are no refunds with less than a
 4 week notice.
 
 14. CANCELLATION BY PROVIDER.
 14.1 Alternative No. 1:
 (a) At the end of (4) four week trial period. Date being: __________ per conditions
 outlined in section 13.
 (b) Immediate Cancellation: Provider may terminate child’s enrollment in provider’s
 program effective immediately upon written or verbal notification to parent of such
 termination, if any of the following conditions arise:
 (1) In the judgment of the Provider, if a child’s behavior poses significant threat to the
 physical or mental health or well-being of one or more of the other children at the family
 child care home and the Provider is unable to reasonably eliminate the threat: a
 temporary suspension from the program may be necessary or complete termination.
 (2) Any payment owed by Parent to Provider is not paid within seven (7) days after such
 payment is due;
 (3) Child is picked up late more than four (4) times in any thirty (30) day period without
 Notification and agreement.
 (4) Mutually agreed upon irreconcilable differences
 
 If provider terminates or suspends child’s enrollment mid-week pursuant to any of the
 reasons set forth in 14.1 and 14.2 no refunds will be given.
 
 14.2 Alternative No. 2:
 (a) Two-Weeks Notice. Provider may terminate child’s enrollment in the family child care
 home effective upon two (2) weeks prior written notice to Parent if any of the following
 conditions arise:
 (1) Any of the conditions listed under Section (b) above, provided that Provider has not
 exercised her right to terminated child’s enrollment immediately;
 (2) In the objective judgment of Provider, Provider’s program does not meet the
 developmental or special needs of Child;
 (3) Parent fails to abide by any other terms of this Agreement; or
 (4) Provider ceases to operate a family child care home.
 
 15. HOLIDAYS AND PROVIDERS’S SICK TIME AND
 VACATION.
 Provider follows all Federal and Newton School Holidays and all school closings due to
 inclement weather, no care will be provided on the following days with pay.
 These holidays will be billed as though care were provided if the holiday or closing due
 to inclement weather falls on your contracted day. Provider will take two weeks paid
 vacation *(your non-refundable deposit) per year. I close every summer for
 approximately 6 weeks.
 Please note: your deposit along with this contract goes towards my vacation that
 takes place at the end of the current school year.
 
 1). Providers are allowed 3 closed sick days per year if no coverage is available or more
 specifically if I am the one that is ill since daycare is in my own home.
 2). Provider reserves the right to take additional unpaid personal days during the year
 with but not limited to a 2 weeks advance notice, however, some things are beyond
 control (i.e. death in family, sickness in family, etc.) Every effort will be made (but not
 guaranteed) to secure back-up child care if needed.

 advance.
 
 Please note: The last day of my school year schedule for the year of 2026 is
 currently June 26th.
 
 16. BACK UP CHILD CARE: If back up child care is scheduled and provided
 for any child during my vacation or sick/personal days all policies herein are enforced
 and applied. I reserve the right to provide back up care in my own home on days when
 conflicts of meetings/schedules may apply (i.e. doctor appointments, etc.) Backup care
 will be provided by approved assistants (this includes my REMOVED, daughters and son),
 and or licensed providers in their own homes. Every approved assistant has been
 fingerprinted and CORI’d according to the laws of Massachusetts.
 
 17. REFERRALS: Referrals from a client is one of the biggest compliments I can
 receive. If you are happy with your child’s care and with us please do recommend my
 program to your co-workers, colleagues, neighbors, mom’s groups, etc.
 
 18. DUTY TO REPORT CHILD ABUSE. As a mandated reporter, I am
 required by law to report to the local Child Protective Agency of any suspected physical,
 emotional, sexual or suspected abuse or neglect.
 19. GUIDELINES FOR RELEASING CHILDREN. Provider will only
 release a child to:
 1) parents with legal custody or to the child’s legal guardian, or
 2) anyone the custodial parent has authorized by prior arrangement with Provider with a
 verbal consent, or
 3) police or welfare workers with proper authorization.
 *If there is a court order keeping one parent away from the child, I must have a written
 note from the custodial parent in my file to that effect. Otherwise, I cannot prevent the
 non-custodial parent from picking up the child.
 
 20. TRANSPORTATION AND FIELD TRIPS: We occasionally go on
 outings that include but are not limited to walks in the woods, walks around the
 neighborhood and trips to the neighborhood playground. Normal mode of transportation
 would be on foot with the use of carriages as needed.
 
 21. TOYS/PERSONAL ITEMS: Absolutely no toys should be brought from
 home. If your child needs a special toy or “lovey” for sleeping it should be put in your
 child’s cubby immediately upon arrival and will be used only for that purpose. Personal
 Sippy cups are not allowed, I have plenty. Pacifiers for children over the age of 12
 months are used only for nap time. If a child chews on their pacifier then it will
 immediately be removed to never be used again. Should a child deliberately destREMOVED my
 toys or other property through misuse or willfulness, the parent will be asked to replace
 it. In addition: absolutely no toys or books may be taken from the daycare at any time.
 Please do not ask me to make an exception. This puts all of us in an awkward position
 and I will not be made to be the “bad” guy when I respond with a no.
 
 22. MEALS/FOOD: I provide a healthy breakfast for children arriving by 8:00am;
 lunch and a morning & afternoon snack. The children are offered the food, not forced to
 eat. Children who choose not to eat will not be served additional food until the next
 snack or mealtime. Please do not send food (half-eaten breakfasts, candy, snacks or
 gum) from home; this is strictly prohibited. At times I may have children in my care with
 food allergies, and even coming in contact with some foods can be life threatening. If
 your child has eaten something in the car prior to arrival please be sure their hands and
 face have been cleaned prior to entering the premises. We welcome food to be sent for
 special occasions and celebrations such as birthdays. Please check with me first about
 what foods may or may not be allowed. Any outside food must have the store bought or
 hand made ingredients clearly labeled. Parents need to supply Infant formula/breast
 milk and baby food until age 12 months or as soon as table food is introduced and they
 are no longer eating baby food.
 
 22a. BREAST MILK & BREAST FEEDING:
 All breast milk must be clearly labeled with a date and child’s name. All breast milk
 should come in freezer bags. While we absolutely encourage breastfeeding please do
 not expect to breast feed upon morning arrival, early departures and/or afternoon pick
 up. This is my personal home and my family may be present at any moment which may
 be awkward for them and possibly for you. Also, I just do not have the space to allow.
 Please breastfeed in your own home or in your car prior to morning arrival or after you
 have picked up your child for the day.
 
 23. SPECIAL DIETS: If a child has a particular dietary need, substantiated by a
 medical evaluation or religious beliefs. Substitute meals or snacks may then be brought
 from home if deemed necessary.
 
 24. SUPPLIES NEEDED: Parents are responsible for supplying diapers &
 wipes, weather appropriate change of clothes (2 changes of clothes for children who are
 being toilet trained and infants) and any other necessary items (powder, ointment, sun
 screen, bug spray, etc.) I have all the sleeping mats, sheets, blankets and port-a-cribs
 that are needed. All these items are cleaned/laundered weekly or as soiled.
 NOTE: Please leave all diaper bags & back packs at home. I do not have the additional
 space for these items. I ask that all parents are to bring a large supply of both diapers
 & wipes (large as in the size you get at Costco). All diapers & wipes are used as
 community supplies. Your child will always be in a size appropriate diaper. I will notify
 you via email as new supplies are needed. Parents may choose to opt out of the
 community supplies if you are using a specific type of diaper (7th generation or cloth
 diapers) Parents are still required to supply these items as well as the baby wipes.
  I have a large supply of snow pants, hats, mittens, some back-up winter boots, and
 summer sun hats. It is easier for me to use my items so that I do not need to find which
 special hat or mitten, etc. belongs to which child. I will let parents know if I do require
 that you do send any of these items. All items are laundered weekly. During warmer
 months when we start to do water play please be sure that the first application of
 SunScreen is done prior to your child’s arrival at daycare. We will re-apply as needed
 during the day, however we follow the shade and stay pretty well covered. Children will
 get wet in the clothes and shoes that they arrive in. Please be sure that your child’s
 cubby is restocked with clean dry clothes.
 
  1.​COMMUNICATION: I AM ALWAYS OPEN TO SUGGESTIONS AND
  FEEL COMMUNICATION A VERY IMPORTANT PART OF THIS BUSINESS.
  WE WILL BRIEFLY COMMUNICATE EACH MORNING AND AFTERNOON
  ABOUT ANY ISSUES, CONCERNS OR JUST GENERAL INFORMATION. I
  ENCOURAGE YOU TO SPEAK OPENLY AND CANDIDLY WITH ME. IF A
  LENGTHY CONVERSATION IS NEEDED, A TIME THAT IS CONVENIENT FOR
  BOTH OF US WILL BE SCHEDULED, AS THE CHILDREN STILL NEED MY
  ATTENTION DURING BUSINESS HOURS. IT IS MY PLEASURE AND
  PRIVILEGE TO WORK WITH YOU AND YOUR CHILD; I LOOK FORWARD TO
  A WONDERFUL YEAR AND RELATIONSHIP.
 
 ADDITIONAL CONSIDERATIONS
 
 26. MODIFICATION/AMENDMENT. Provider reserves the right to modify or
 amend this agreement upon two (2) weeks written notice of any changes in the basic
 rates or services and do not require any prior notice to Parents. No amendment or
 modification hereof shall be valid unless it is in writing and signed by all the parties.
 
 26a. COVID 19
 Due to the uncertainty of the COVID 19 virus or any related illnesses I will need to follow EEC,
 CDC, or any governmental requirements regarding closing of my daycare. Since 2022 we are
 required to close our doors if any unvaccinated child has been confirmed to have the virus or
 has come into direct contact with an infected individual. You are required to advise me of any
 such exposure or confirmation to the child and any family member living in the same household.
 Any daycare closings that are COVID related are nonrefundable.
 
 Moving forward:
 Should another wave of virus or any unforeseen government emergency occur or plateau during
 the school year whereas I am unable to provide childcare the following will take place. Up to
 one additional calendar/full month of contracted child care will be billed to each family preceding
 my closing date. This money will not be held or credited for future use, it simply holds your child
 space in my daycare. You may opt at this time to give me a one month notice to terminate your
 contract, however one month will be billed. If for any reason my child care facility's closure
 extends past that one additional month I"

 Thank you for reaching out about the Early Learning Center (ELC). I listed some
 of the basic information below based on the previous school year and attached an
 application which you can simply complete and email back to me, and I will add
 your little one to the inquiry list. We have aligned our acceptances with the
 Pre-K-3 admissions process, reenrollment occurs in February, and newly admitted
 families receive word in early March should we have availability. We do give
 priority to Beauvoir as well as PECF (Beauvoir, NCS, STA, and Cathedral)
 employees and then siblings. It truly depends on the year as to affiliations
 and other community members who join us in the ELC. Unfortunately, at this time
 we are unable to accept students without the above affiliations, we will reach
 out to those on the inquiry list should that change. It is always best to
 complete the application and be added to the inquiry list just in case and if
 your little one will be four by August 31, 2026, please feel free reach out to
 the admissions office to apply for Pre-K. Please feel free to reach out if you
 have any questions as I am happy to arrange a time to connect.
 
 All the best, Colleen

  Hi REMOVED, I am so sorry to hear this. Can you share what Daycare it was just so
  I have an idea if we are going to get a lot of calls? Are you aware our 3
  year olds only come in the mornings Monday-Wednesday? We do not have full
  time care in our program for 3's. With that said we have an amazing program
  with curriculum alignment with the district to build the foundational skills
  for success to twelfth grade.

 Thank you for your inquiry. We don't have a preschool at Mountain School (since
 2020), so I'm wondering where you found the information that might have
 indicated that? We are a K-5 charter school, so your child could be entered
 into an enrollment lottery for Kindergarten (by Jan 31 of the year they turn 5

 the end of January so that prospective families can see the school and meet the
 teachers. The next one is Saturday, January 24th from 1-2:30 pm.

199b25fdd2f0912a,"Hi REMOVED and REMOVED,
 Thank you for your email. We have a toddler spot available immediately. If you'd
 like to visit, we are interviewing families over the next few weeks. If you're
 interested in visiting, please answer the questions below.
 Below are some questions that help us to decide who we may be able to provide
 care for. Because some questions are of a personal or medical nature, you are
 not required to answer them. However, the questions help us to get an idea of
 what families would be a good fit for our daycare.
 
 1. How old is your child?
 
 2. How many adults and children are living in your household? Please provide
 names for all members in the household.
 
 3. What is your current child care situation? What past childcare have you
 had? Are you on the waiting list at any other daycares?
 
 4. Do you have a plan for care if your child is sick?
 
 5. What days and hours would you like?
 
 6. When would you like to start care?
 
 7. Where are you located and how long have you lived in the area?
 
 8. Does your child have any known food or environmental allergies?
 
 9. Have the adults and children over the age of 6 months old in the house
 received a covid-19 vaccine?
 
 10. How often does your family travel for work or vacations?
 
 11. How did you hear about us?
 
 We’d also love to hear any other information you’d like to share about your
 family such as hobbies, holidays celebrated or values specific to you.
 
 Please note that we have family members with suppressed immune systems, so if
 anyone in your family is feeling ill, experiencing symptoms or had a recent
 exposure to anyone who is sick, please let us know and we will be happy to
 reschedule your viewing of our daycare.

 The Mendham Cooperative Nursery School is all about community. During the
 course of the year, our director, teachers, and parents come together to make our
 school a truly special place. When you enroll in our cooperative preschool, you
 become a member of a warm, welcoming, and productive community, and it is
 our hope that you’ll desire to participate as much as your time allows.
 
 We offer classes for all ages - we have a toddler program, 2s,
 3s and 4s. We are a play based preschool that makes
 learning exciting for all ages! Our littlest learners focus on
 socialization and learning how to share and cooperate. Our
 older students practice those important academic skills
 including listening and following directions in addition to
 learning letters, sounds and numbers. Fine and gross motor
 skills are always incorporated into fun and engaging activities.
 We strive to help all of our children to become independent
 and ready for kindergarten.
 
 The Co-op has visits from community helpers throughout the year and we take
 field trips to further enhance the curriculum. Our dedicated staff loves to come to
 work as much as the children love to come to school!

 Hello,
 
 I realize this is short notice. Our daycare just closed unexpectedly, and we are
 looking for childcare options for our three year old. When might a spot open up?
 Also, can we schedule an appointment with you to discuss?
 
 My REMOVED REMOVED and I look forward to hearing from you.
 
 Thanks,
 REMOVED"
199c4685695353d5,"Good morning REMOVED,
 Thank you for your interest in our school.
 Please let us know your child's name, birth date and what schedule you are
 looking for. Also, is your child toilet-trained? We have one opening in the
 3-4 year old class. These children nap and must be toilet trained. We also
 have one opening in the 2-3 year old toddler class. These children also nap but
 do not have to be toilet trained.
 As soon as we hear back from you we can schedule a private tour.
 If you have any questions please let us know.
 Theresa Lester, Admin. Asst.

 Dear Parent,
 
 Thank you for your interest in Pine Village Preschool JP South Street! We are delighted that you
 are considering our childcare center for your child's educational journey. Pine Village Preschool is a
 highly respected Spanish Immersion School for Toddlers and Preschoolers with 10 locations in the
 Greater Boston area.
 
 Why Families Choose Pine Village Preschool
 Spanish Immersion: Our full immersion language school means that educators teach the regular
 curriculum exclusively in Spanish. While we speak Spanish 100% of the day, we support children in
 their native language (English) as needed so that they can learn Spanish gradually over time.
 
 Nutritious Meals and Snacks: We are one of the few childcare centers that operate our own private
 catering service with a focus on from-scratch, healthy, and nutritious meals. Children receive a hot
 lunch, two delicious snacks and milk throughout the day.
 
 Individualized Learning: Our play-based, Spanish immersion curriculum nurtures children’s social,
 emotional, cognitive, physical, and language development. This approach fosters exploration,
 curiosity, and creativity, allowing children to develop their interests and abilities at their own pace.
 
 Parent Communication: Via a mobile app, parents can view images and access daily updates on
 activities your child is enjoying, what they have eaten (and how much!), nap times, diaper changes,
 and more!
 
 Flexible Care: Pine Village Preschool supports each family’s unique schedule by offering both part-
 time and full-time care, along with flexible drop-off and pick-up times. Our full day is 8am to
 3:30pm and our extended day is 8am to 5:30pm.
 
 We look forward to welcoming you and your child to our family!

199bb0b36e7c9586,"Hi! Can I ask where you got my information from? Surprisingly, or totally meant
 to be, this Friday is the last day for one of my 2 1/2 year olds, and I was
 planning on putting the space available with Colorado Shines. I'm going to give
 you some basic information to make sure we move forward.
 I only offer full-time care. I am open Monday through Friday, 7:30 - 5, so you'd
 be able to come anytime during those hours and days.
 We do have dogs, and they have supervised time with the kids and then are
 separated to their own area.
 I have been licensed for 23 years, and have a large family license, which means
 I can watch up to 12 kids. I don't always, but I am allowed.
 My rate is $300 a week, regardless of care (if you're out sick or if it's my
 vacation)
 I belong to the food program (same as the schools, it just means I have another
 licensing type check), therefore, I provide all meals and snacks.
 If that still sounds good, I can send you my policies and such, and I can be
 available on Wednesday at 5 to meet.
 Thank You,

199b4b5b58759b0b,"Hi REMOVED,
 I am sorry to hear that your center closed. Thank you for reaching out regarding
 enrollment at our childcare center. I'd like to share that our center is a
 benefit exclusively for Wellstar team members who are directly employed and paid
 by Wellstar. This means contractors, affiliates, and PRN team members are not
 eligible to utilize this benefit.
 To proceed, please provide your full name and employee ID number so we may
 verify your employment status within the Wellstar system. Once verified, your
 child will be placed on the waitlist for potential enrollment.
 Please note that both placement on the waitlist and any future enrollment offer
 are contingent upon your current employment status at the time space becomes
 available. Additionally, continued enrollment in the center is dependent on
 maintaining active employment with Wellstar. If at any point it's determined
 that eligibility requirements are not met, access to the childcare centers will
 no longer be available to you and your family.
 If you have any questions, we're happy to assist.

 Good Morning REMOVEDs. Miller,
 Thank you so much for reaching out to us. I am so sorry to hear that your
 current school is closing unexpectedly- I can only imagine how stressful that
 must be for you and your family.
 We would be happy to help make this transition as smooth as possible for your
 three-year-old.
 Little Blessings of West Plano has a robust preschool program. It includes a
 curriculum focused on the whole child. This classroom does have limited space
 available.
 I would love to invite you to meet us. Please let me know a convenient time for
 you to visit the school or speak with us by phone so that we can discuss
 enrollment details, scheduling, and answer any questions you may have.
 We look forward to the opportunity to support your child's continued growth and

 About This Handbook
 This handbook will help to explain our school and our operational policies further. We reserve
 the right to update this handbook at any time, but we will let families know if we do. Please take
 a few minutes to become familiar with this information, along with the Enrollment Application
 provided to you. On your Enrollment Application, you will be asked to acknowledge your receipt
 and agreement to the policies outlined in this handbook.
 
 This handbook has been written in accordance with the Department of Children & Families
 Office of Licensing Manual of Requirements as required for all childcare centers.
 
 Who We Are
 Precious People Early Learning Center was founded in 1997. We are family owned and we’ve
 intentionally stayed small. We pride ourselves on establishing personal connections with
 families and giving each child the love and attention they need to blossom and grow.
 
 Precious People welcome children from age eighteen months through six years. Our programs
 include:
  • Chipmunk Class (Early Preschool)
  • Squirrel Class (Preschool)
  • Bunny Class (Full Day Kindergarten)
  • Extended Care (Before & After care)
  • Summer Camp (9 weeks filled with fun and sun)
 
 We are very flexible and are happy to work with you to create a schedule that works for your
 child and family. We offer enrollments from 3-5 days a week with three different pick-up times
 to meet your needs.
 
 Precious People is open fifty weeks per year. Our school year runs from Tuesday after Labor Day
 through the third week in June. Our summer Camp runs from the last week in June through the
 third week in August and enrollments for camp are done on a month-to-month basis.
 
 Dedication
 A positive early learning experience has an enormous impact on a child’s life. Each moment of
 early childhood is precious. We feel lucky to share those moments with your children and
 promise to fill their days with wonder, friendship, love and laughter. Precious People Early
 Learning Center is dedicated to the memory of Jack Antonio Sanzalone, the amazingly precious
 person who inspired our Founder to create our school.
 
  4
 REMOVEDion Statement
 Our mission is to provide a nurturing, safe, and stimulating environment where children can
 grow emotionally, socially, and intellectually through play-based learning and compassionate
 care. We partner with families to support each child’s unique developmental journey and foster
 a lifelong love of learning.
 
 Our Purpose
 Our purpose is to provide a nurturing, educational environment where children develop
 foundational skills for lifelong learning while giving parents peace of mind through exceptional
 care, long-tenured teachers, and communication.
 
 We believe childhood is precious and should be filled with wonder, joy, and discovery. We
 protect and celebrate this special time while gently preparing children for their next steps. We
 understand both the privilege and responsibility of caring for your children.
 
 Our Values
  a) Individualized Care – Every child is known, loved, and supported as a unique individual.
  b) Play-Based Learning – We nurture natural curiosity and growth through hands-on
  exploration.
  c) Family Partnership – We work hand-in-hand with families to support each child’s
  development.
  d) Whole-Child Focus – Emotional, social, physical, and cognitive needs are nurtured
  together.
  e) Safe & Loving Environment – Our space is built on trust, warmth, and genuine care.
 
 Physical Environment
 Our center is located on a spacious property a few short blocks from the Westfield train station.
 Our three classrooms are bright, open and airy. Learning centers in each class are devoted to
 art, block play, dramatic play, math, science, reading and computers. We constantly update and
 improve our classrooms to ensure that our children have the highest quality learning materials.
 Outdoors, in our fully fenced, secure playground, there’s lots of great equipment and plenty of
 room to run and play. We believe a connection with nature and the outdoors is really important
 for young children, and we endeavor to have our children have the opportunity to play, learn
 and develop in our large playground, surrounded by trees and nature. We use certified
 playground organic materials to provide a safe environment for the children, and during
 Summer Camp, we have two Splash Days per week, giving the children a fun and active
 connection with the outdoors.
 
  5
 Our Teachers & Staff
 We are proud of our facility, but our staff makes Precious People really special. When you walk
 into our daycare, you will quickly feel the warmth and dedication from our incredible staff. We
 are not just a team; we're truly a family, and that feeling extends to every child and parent who
 joins us. Our three head of classroom teachers have each been with us for between 12 and 15
 years, a testament to their deep love for our school and the children we serve. This long-
 standing commitment means familiar faces for your little ones, consistent care, and a wealth of
 experience guiding their growth and development. They pour their hearts into creating a
 nurturing environment where every child feels safe, valued, and excited to learn each day.
 Kristine Monahan has been our director for four years and is also our Chipmunk Head Teacher.
 She is committed to ensuring that every child has the best possible school experience. Her door
 is always open.
 
 Our other wonderful teachers have also been with us for many years. They are dedicated,
 caring, educated professionals. Our teacher to child ratio exceeds all legal requirements and
 allows our teachers to provide each child with great personal attention and encouragement.
 
 Licensing & Accreditation
 Our school is state-licensed and regularly inspected to ensure everything meets or exceeds
 standards, including child-to-teacher ratios and safe facilities. Precious People is subject to
 inspection by state and local health, fire, licensing, and building agencies. Regulations and
 inspections pertain to staff qualifications, the facility and playground, nutrition, health and
 safety matters, record-keeping, and child-to-staff ratios. If you have any questions regarding
 licensing or regulations, please speak with the Director.
 
 Educational Programming
 Our Curriculum
 Our play-based curriculum is designed to help each of our young learners reach his or her full
 potential. This comprises:
  a. Child-Led Exploration
  i. Activities are guided by children's interests and choices.
  ii. Teachers observe and support rather than direct.
  iii. Encourages autonomy and decision-making.
  b. Developmentally Appropriate Practice
  i. Learning experiences match children's age and stage.
  ii. Focus on emotional, social, cognitive, and physical growth.
 
  6
  iii. Emphasizes process over product—how children learn matters more than what
  they produce.
  c. Integrated Learning Through Play
  i. Combines academic concepts (like math, literacy, science) with playful
  experiences.
  ii. Examples: counting blocks, storytelling during pretend play and nature walks for
  science exploration.
  d. Social-Emotional Development
  i. Group play fosters cooperation, empathy, and communication.
  ii. Teachers model and support emotional regulation and conflict resolution.
  e. Safe and Stimulating Environment
  i. Classrooms are designed to invite play—open-ended materials, cozy reading
  nooks, sensory stations.
  ii. Outdoor play is essential for physical development and imaginative exploration.
  f. Teacher as Facilitator
  i. Educators scaffold learning by asking open-ended questions and introducing new
  vocabulary.
  ii. They connect play to learning goals without interrupting the flow of play.
 
 Kindergarten
 Our accredited Kindergarten follows the Westfield Public School District curriculum and
 empowers students to develop the skills they need to excel in first grade and beyond. These
 days, children enter Kindergarten with lots of knowledge. Many have been in preschool for
 some time, are familiar with letters and numbers and are excited to learn more. Our objective at
 Precious People is to build on their knowledge to create a strong foundation in literacy, math,
 science and social studies. Our literacy program includes phonics, journal writing, reading
 groups and quality children’s chapter books read aloud. Our math program includes hands–on
 exposure to addition and subtraction, telling time, handling money, and the creation of charts,
 graphs and diagrams. Our science program includes class participation in exciting experiments.
 Our Kindergarten children graduate from Precious People extremely well prepared to enter first
 grade.
 
 Just as important, we help prepare our children for the difficult job of navigating society. Our
 Kindergartners are given the freedom and responsibility and making choices and acting on
 those choices in the classroom setting. They work together in small groups and are encouraged
 to participate in classroom discussions. When a conflict arises, our children are helped to
 
  7
 resolve it themselves. This helps our children learn the social skills and self-reliance that will be
 so important for the rest of their lives.
 
 Summer Camp
 Our fun-filled theme-based summer program runs from the last week of June through the third
 week of August and includes highlights like:
  • Visitors (e.g. petting zoo, puppet show, reptile man)
  • Outdoor arts and crafts
  • Twice weekly splash days
  • Enrichment activities such as Amazing Athletes
  • Theme based picnics.
 
 The School Day
 Your Child’s First Day
 Preparing for the first day of school can be exciting, but it can also be an overwhelming and
 anxious time – we understand! We will work with you to make your child’s first day the best it
 can be. Don’t hesitate to share any concerns you have before that first drop-off. Each child is
 unique in their patterns and ease of adjustment to new situations. Parents will say good-bye to
 their child at the front door. Be sure to talk with the Teachers daily during the transition phase.
 A consistent daily schedule (arrival and departure routines) also helps children adjust to a new
 routine and environment.
 
 On the first day, we ask that you send in the items listed below. Please make sure to label each
 item with your child’s name. Your Precious Person will need:
  • Two sets of a seasonally appropriate change of clothes in a zip lock bag labeled with
  your child’s name
  • Breakfast (if needed and arriving before 8:40am) and lunch
  • A month’s supply of diapers and wipes (if applicable)
  • An updated immunization record AND universal health form
  • A water bottle
  • A nap time mat
  • A stuffed animal or extra blanket if you choose
 
 You are welcome to use our bicycle and stroller parking area at your own risk, this area is not
 securely monitored.
 
  8
 Transition to School
 It takes time for young child to become accustomed to new places, people and routines. To aid
 your child in making a smooth transition to the Center and to help him or her make a positive
 attachment to the teachers, we ask that Chipmunk families follow the procedure outlined
 below. These procedures may take a week or so. It is time well spent!
 
 Stage 1: Bring your child to school between 10:00 and 11:30. After saying a cheerful goodbye at
 the door, leave them for approximately 1 hour.
 
 Stage 2: Your child arrives at 9:00, stays in the school through lunch and is picked up at 12:30.
 
 Hours of Operation
 We are open from 7:00 a.m. until 5:30 p.m. Monday-Friday. Our academic day starts with circle
 time at 9:00 a.m. Please be sure that your child arrives at or before 9:00 a.m. This will give you
 a chance to touch base with your child’s teacher and allow our circle to proceed uninterrupted.
 
 Children here for morning preschool are picked up at 12:30, a full day ends at 3:00 and Children
 here for extended care must be picked up by 5:30. Please be prompt in picking up your child. A
 consistent pattern of late pick-ups may result in a late fee.

 the third week in June. During the school year, we are closed:

  • President’s Day

  9
 Late Pickup Policy
 A parent who does not arrive by the pick-up time for which they have paid for the month will be
 charged a $5.00 late fee plus $1.00 for every minute they are late arriving. Consistent late pick-
 ups could result in a child’s dismissal from the program or need to change enrollment to a later
 pick-up time. All late fees accumulated within a month will be paid as part of the following
 month’s tuition on the first day of the month.
 
 Nutrition
 Please bring your child’s lunch in a lunch box. A microwave and refrigerator are available in
 each room. Please advise us in writing if your child has food allergies. You are welcome to send
 your child in with breakfast if they are dropped off prior to 8:30am.
 
 Snacks will be provided to all children or you are welcome to send in your own.
 
 Toilet Learning
 Mastery of toilet learning gives child feelings of accomplishment, independence and self-
 confidence. Therefore, use of the potty is gently suggested at the times when the children wash
 their hands – before snacks, when they come in from outdoor time, before lunch and after nap.
 Children are always praised for their attempts to use the potty, but are never belittled if they are
 not ready to do so.
 
 Rest Time
 Rest time for our Chipmunks is from 1:00 to 3:00, for our Squirrels from 1:00 to 2:30 and for our
 Bunnies from 12:45 to 1:30. Children are encouraged to nap but not required to do so. Children
 who are not napping after a reasonable amount of time will be given a quiet activity to do. If
 your child is enrolled for a 12:30 pick up but you would, on occasion, like them to stay at
 Precious People for rest time, it is a $20 fee per child per day.
 
 Screen Time & Technology
 Chipmunks have no sitting screen-time no matter the number of hours in care. In Squirrel and
 Bunny classrooms, sitting screen time is limited to 30 minutes except for an occasional holiday
 movie, but never exceeding one hour. Aftercare students may do short exercise/movement
 videos if they are physically active during the videos.
 
 Social Media
 This social media policy applies to parents and all staff of Precious People Early Learning Center.
 This policy includes (but is not limited to) the following technologies:
 
  10
  • Social networking sites (e.g. Facebook & Instagram) • Blogs • Discussion forums •
  Collaborative online spaces • Media Sharing services (e.g. YouTube) • Micro-blogging
  (e.g. Twitter)
 
 As part of our duty to safeguard children, it is essential to maintain the privacy and security of
 all our families. We therefore require that:
  • Staff members may post photographs of students on Precious People’s social networking
  pages only with the express written consent of the child’s parent.
  • No photographs taken within the preschool setting or at preschool special events and
  outings with the children, are to be posted for public viewing, except those of your own
  child. Parents are advised that they do not have a right to photograph anyone else’s child
  or to upload photos of anyone else’s children. (This excludes those photographs taken by
  staff for use on the Precious People Facebook page and in other advertising material).
  • No public discussions are to be held, or comments made on social media sites regarding
  the school children, staff, or business (except appropriate use for marketing fundraising
  events) or that could be construed to have any impact on the school’s reputation or that
  would offend any member of staff or parent associated with the school.
  • Staff are advised to manage their personal security settings to ensure that their
  information is only available to people they choose to share information with.
  • Staff should not accept parents as friends due to it being a breach of expected
  professional conduct unless they already know them in a personal capacity before their
  child starts at preschool. Staff should avoid personal communication, including on social
  networking sites, with the children and parents with whom they act in a professional
  capacity. If the staff names the preschool or workplace in any social media, they do so in
  a way that is not detrimental to the school or its families.
  • Staff observe confidentiality and refrain from discussing any issues relating to work. Staff
  should not share information they would not want children, parents or colleagues to
  view.
  • Staff and parents should report any concerns or breaches to the Director. Any member
  of staff, parent or volunteer found to be posting photos, remarks or comments that
  breach confidentiality, bring the preschool into disrepute or that are deemed to be of a
  detrimental nature to the preschool or other employees, or posting/publishing
  photographs of the setting, children or staff may face disciplinary action in line with the
  disciplinary procedures.
  • Any comment deemed to be inappropriate is to be reported to the Director or a staff
  member of the preschool and any action taken will be at their discretion.
 
  11
 Note: Precious People will use social media as a means of parent communication and for
 marketing purposes throughout the year
 
 Enrollment, Tuition, and Exit
 Admissions Process
 Children are eligible for admission at the age of 18 months. The admission process begins with a
 tour of the school. Children are enrolled on a first-come, first-serve basis, depending on
 availability in the most developmentally appropriate class. Children are placed on a waiting list if
 there is no availability in the most appropriate class. Once our classes fill, a wait list is created.
 To place your child’s name on the wait list, you must complete an Enrollment Application.
 
 Our classes are as follows:
 
  • Chipmunks: 18 months to 3 years old
  • Squirrels: 3 to 5 years old
  • Bunnies: Kindergartners
 
 Spaces are filled from the waiting list according to the following priority system:
 
  • Siblings of currently enrolled children
  • Previous Precious People families
  • General Public
 
 If a space becomes available, the child whose name is first on the wait list will be contacted. If
 that family wishes to enroll their child, we must receive the registration fee plus the child’s first
 week’s tuition within three business days. If we do not receive this deposit within three days,
 the spot will be offered to the next child on the waiting list. When space becomes available
 during the school year, it can be held for a maximum of thirty days. This allows the child to
 complete the month at their current school/childcare center.
 
 Enrollment Policy
 The school year begins during the first week of September. Registration for each school year
 starts in January of the preceding year, all fees and deposits are nonrefundable.
 
  1. For new students, after parents are notified of the admission date, you must complete
  the Precious People Enrollment Application and pay the non-refundable registration fee
  of $100 and first two weeks’ tuition as a deposit are required to reserve your child’s
  space
 
  12
  Upon receipt of the Application and payment of registration fees, the parent receives
  the Parent’s Handbook, additional forms/policies, and health and immunization forms.
  2. For returning students in our Chipmunk and Squirrel classrooms who are attending
  summer camp, a completed Application is required with no annual registration fee.
  3. For all students not attending summer camp and those students attending the Bunny
  Kindergarten program, the first two weeks’ tuition for September as a deposit is due
  when enrolling to hold your child’s space.
 
 On the first day a child attends school, the office must have in each child’s file:
 
  • A completed and signed Enrollment Application
  • Completed medical action plan (if applicable)
 
 Within 30 days of a child’s first date of attendance:
 
  • A health assessment by a licensed physician (Universal Health Form completed)
  • A record of immunization or a completed exemption form
 
 PLEASE NOTE: We are required to have each of these forms in our files to maintain our license
 to operate. State law requires us to exclude from school any student whose files are incomplete
 until we have received their missing paperwork. We appreciate your cooperation.
 
 Tuition
 There is a 10% discount for a sibling simultaneously attending Precious People. Tuition fees will
 remain constant from September through June. Tuition is due on the child’s first day of
 attendance of each month unless other arrangements are made.
 
 If your child is scheduled for 12:30 pickup but you would like your child to nap/rest at Precious
 People on occasion, it is a fee of $20 per child per day.
 
 Additionally,
 
  • All tuition and fees are nonrefundable
  • All tuition payments are due on the 1st of each month
  • The 2-week deposit paid at registration is applied to your first tuition payment unless
  you push back your start date and then another 2-week deposit is required for each
  newly defined start date
  • Payments are made for a place in Precious People’s programs and not for a period of
  attendance. The absence of a student does not materially decrease the expenses of the
  school. Hence, students are accepted for the entire school year.
  • You will be required to bring your account up to date to register for the following year or
  camp if tuition is owed at those times
 
  13
  • No bills or invoices are sent
  • No reduction or credit on the tuition will be granted if a student is expelled or is
  voluntarily withdrawn.
  • In the event of a mandated school closure we will provide a full day zoom schedule in
  place of in person classes until it is safe to return. Full tuition will be due to maintain our
  teachers' salaries, building and insurance.
 
 Late Payment Policy
 Monthly tuition is due by the 1st of every month. If tuition is two weeks late, a $50.00 late fee is
 added. If payment is three weeks late, an additional $75.00 late fee is added, and the child’s
 spot may be offered to a child on the waiting list.
 
 No child may be re-enrolled until the family’s account, plus any"

 Coalition of Duval. Hogan Lane’s VPK students score kindergarten-ready. We are
 open Monday through Friday from 7:00 to 5:30. Tours are by appointment only on
 Tuesdays, Wednesdays, and Thursdays at 9:00 AM or 1:00 PM. If these dates and

 convenient tour time. We look forward to meeting your family. I look forward to
 meeting you.
 
 We have availability for ages two and up. There is no enrollment fee.
 
 We have availability in our VPK Classroom for the 2025-26 school year. Our VPK
 class is held on Tuesdays, Wednesdays, and Thursdays from 8:30 to 1:30. The lead
 teacher is working towards her master's degree in early special needs education.
 The assistant teacher has an AS degree. She is currently working towards her BS

 many years. Before and after care tuition for VPK is $150.00 per week. The VPK

 PHILOSOPHY
 
 Children's health, safety, and well-being are this center’s first priority.
 The educational intent of Hogan Lane is to facilitate age-appropriate learning
 and behavior. Focusing attention on the importance of children's academics,
 moral, social, physical, and cultural development. All of these can be learned
 through play. Hogan Lane strongly believes scheduling vast amounts of free play
 is important. During this time the children will learn by doing. Children will
 learn and develop at their own pace by selecting activities that interest and
 stimulate them. The more fun they have the more they will thrive. When a child
 is playing, they are exploring and learning. KIDS ARE IMPORTANT AND HOGAN LANE
 LOVES TO INVEST IN THEM!
 
 MISSION STATEMENT
 
 The mission of Hogan Lane is to provide a loving and caring environment where
 children feel comfortable and secure. Hogan Lane strives to provide an
 outstanding experience in the child's social, cognitive, and physical
 development. The goal is for every child to have fun learning!
 
 Play is really the work of childhood. Fred Rogers

 Thank you for your interest and inquiry in Evergreen Montessori. At this time,
 our 3-6 classroom is at capacity and on a waitlist. We do not anticipate having
 an opening until Fall of 2026. For the next school year, re-registration for
 our existing students will take place in January, and open enrollment for

 I am attaching a copy of our handbook for your review. Please note that the
 cost of tuition will increase for the 2026-27 school year and is not reflected
 in this year's handbook. Additionally, we follow an academic calendar with days
 off for holidays and in-service, and we are closed during Summer months except
 for 2 Summer Camps.
 Please let me know if you have any questions after reviewing our handbook, and

 REMOVEDion Statement
 At Evergreen Montessori, each child’s interests are respected, and we strive to assist in developing all aspects
 of the child’s being…social, emotional, spiritual, physical, and academic. We have a unique, low student to
 teacher ratio in a multi-age setting. Our peaceful and well-prepared classroom is designed to bring an
 element of choice into each child’s daily learning activities which empowers them to establish their
 independence. We do our best to provide a safe and nurturing learning environment where children can
 thrive and develop the necessary tools to become life-long learners. Evergreen Montessori aims to build
 relationships between children, families, educators, and the community, thereby establishing strong bonds
 that will lead to positive social communications and relations.
 
 Admission Procedures
  1. Ongoing Information – All families interested in enrolling their child at Evergreen Montessori are encouraged to
  view our website and email for a copy of our handbook. If families are interested in pursuing a possible
  enrollment, we will record their contact information and request some basic information about their child.
 
  2. Re-enrollment - Upon returning from Winter Break, re-registration paperwork will be provided to families
  wishing to return for the following school year. All forms will need to be completely filled-out and returned with
  the necessary fees by the re-registration due date in late January.
 
  3. Informal Interviews – Once open enrollment has begun in February, waitlisted families interested in enrolling
  their child at Evergreen Montessori will be contacted to schedule a tour and an informal interview with the
  Director and lead teacher. The director will explain the Montessori philosophy, daily routine, and answer any
  questions families may have, while the lead teacher will work one-on-one with the child to see how he/she
  responds to direction and the environment.
 
  4. Wait List – Once the class space is filled for the following school year, families wishing for their child to attend
  will be added to our wait list. As space becomes available, these families will be contacted in the order in which
  they were placed on our wait list.
 
 Application Process:
 
  1. Applications from families wishing to continue at Evergreen Montessori are accepted first.
 
  2. Wait list family applications are accepted to enter school during the current or following year.
 
  3. New family applications are accepted to fill remaining available spaces or are placed on our wait list once all
  spaces are filled.
 
 * IMPORTANT REMINDER: Continuing families must re-register each year. Students are not automatically re-enrolled.
 
 Enrollment Packet
 You will receive a registration packet once your child has completed an informal child interview, and it is determined
 that our program is a good fit for your child. All completed forms must be turned into the office before your child may
 attend class. One exception is the Child Health Report, which is due within 30 days.
 
 Emergency Forms
 Current emergency forms providing accurate, up-to-date information are required by law. We should be informed of any
 changes in emergency information at any given time. New emergency forms are required each new school year.
 Additionally, these forms will need to be updated and re-signed for any changes or lack thereof during Parent
 Conferences at the beginning of November and again at the beginning of May.
 Orientation Meeting
 All families will be required to have a parent/guardian of the child enrolled at Evergreen Montessori attend our Parent
 Orientation Meeting at the end of August, prior to the first day of school. Families that have a child starting one of our
 programs in the middle of the year will be asked to attend the Parent Orientation Meeting in August as well.
 
 Special Needs Children
 Special needs children are admitted on a case-by-case basis.
 
 Non-Discrimination Policy
 Evergreen Montessori, LLC admits students of any race, color, religious creed, disability, ancestry, national origin
 (including limited English proficiency), or sex to all the rights, privileges, programs, and activities generally accorded or
 made available to students at the school. It does not discriminate based on race, color, national and ethnic origin, sex,
 political beliefs, marital status, disability, or special needs in administration of its educational policies, admission policies,
 and other school administered programs.
 
 Program services shall be made accessible to eligible persons with disabilities through the most practical and
 economically feasible methods available. These methods include, but are not limited to, equipment redesign, the
 provision of aides, and the use of alternative service delivery locations. Structural modifications shall be considered only
 as a last resort among available methods.
 
 Developmental Needs and Special Services
 At Evergreen Montessori, our philosophy focuses on child development through a constructive means. The teacher may
 identify behavioral or developmental needs in young children that parents may or may not recognize. Every effort will
 be made to involve the parents/guardians in the process of identifying any needs that may arise and working towards
 possible solutions. In these instances, the teacher may recommend professional screening in order to obtain the
 necessary services to help create a successful learning experience for your child.
 
 Termination
 The child's developmental needs come first at Evergreen Montessori. Therefore, if the teacher has a concern that these
 needs are not being appropriately met in our school, or if the teacher believes that our school program cannot meet the
 needs of the parent/guardian, we will work together to identify the problem and seek solutions.
 
 However, if reasonable and appropriate interventions have been attempted and are not resulting in necessary change,
 then Evergreen Montessori may determine that our school is not in the best interest of the child or the parent/guardian.
 In this case, the directress reserves the right to request that the child be withdrawn from the program. Assistance will
 be provided to the family, as best as possible, in finding a program that will meet their child's needs. Withdrawal
 procedures will be implemented in the time frame that Evergreen Montessori believes is appropriate.
 
 IMPORTANT NOTICE: Evergreen Montessori reserves the right to suspend services to any family due to behavioral
 problems in dealing with a child or parents.
 
 Confidentiality
 It is Evergreen Montessori’s policy that any information regarding the child, the child's family, or other matters discussed
 with the Directress will be held in the strictest confidence.

 Tuition Computation/Fees
 There is a $50.00 non-refundable registration fee, a $100.00 non-refundable tuition deposit which is applied to the
 tuition total, and a $250 non-refundable activity and materials fee that is due upon registration. Tuition is determined
 on a yearly basis and is divided by ten with monthly installments being paid from September through June. Our
 operating budget includes periodic holidays, staff in-service days, and anticipated child absences. Tuition is non-
 adjustable. Credits or rebates cannot be given, as Evergreen Montessori has limited enrollment and fixed costs.
 Evergreen Montessori does not send out monthly bills. Therefore, it is the parent(s)/guardian(s) responsibility to make
 sure tuition payments are made NO LATER than the 3rd of each month unless otherwise specified on the Enrollment
 Form.
 
 Second Child Family Discount
 Families that enroll a second child will receive a 10% discount on the second child’s tuition, which will be deducted from
 their monthly payment.
 
 Late Fees
 A late charge of $15.00 is due if your monthly payment is not received by the 5th of each month. If a payment is not
 received by the 15th of the month, the child may not return to school until the tuition balance is paid in full. A $35.00
 fee will be charged to your account for each check labeled with insufficient funds.

 cause, including unpaid tuition.
 Before Care
 Before Care will start at 8:00am, Monday through Friday. There are two options from which to choose. The first option
 is to utilize the services as needed. The cost will be evaluated on a daily basis at a rate of $5.00 per day. The second
 option will be to utilize the services full-time.
 
 If you anticipate the need for before care services at some point during the school year, then we ask you to choose
 option one and complete the registration form. The use of the flexible program will be billed at the beginning of the
 subsequent month.
 
 If you choose to enroll your child in the full-time before care, payment is due at the beginning of each month along with
 tuition. Payment is due NO LATER than the 3rd of each month unless otherwise specified. The cost for this program is
 divided over the course of nine months; therefore, there is no pro-rating of fees based on attendance or holidays. If
 your monthly payment is not received on time, a $15.00 late charge will be assessed. A $35.00 fee will be charged to
 your account for each returned check.
 
 Before Care will not be available if there are any issues with the physical location, the school is closed due to weather, or
 if an emergency situation were to arise. Please note: On days when we operate on a two-hour delay, Before Care will
 not be available.
 
  Before Care Fee Schedule
  Flexible Program $5.00/day
  Full-time Program $65/month
 
  *The cost of the full-time program is at a considerable discount than the daily rate.
 
 Extended Day
 Extended Day will be offered Monday through Friday from your child’s dismissal time until 4:00pm. There are
 two options to choose from when enrolling your child in our Extended Day program. The first option is to
 utilize the services as needed. The cost will be evaluated on a day-by-day, hourly basis at a rate of $10.00 per
 hour. The second option is to utilize the services full-time based on your child’s academic program.
 
 If your child is in the 3 year old program, Extended Day services need to be approved by the director in order to
 register. Please see the fee schedule below for the cost of Option 2.
 
 If you choose to enroll your child in the full-time Extended Day program, payment is due each month starting
 in September and ending in May. Payment is due at the same time as tuition each month. The cost for this
 program is divided over the course of nine months; therefore, there is no pro-rating of fees based on
 attendance or holidays.
 
 If you choose to enroll your child in the flexible program, your cost will be billed monthly based on your usage
 of the program. Therefore, shortly following month’s end, you will receive a statement and your payment will
 be due within one week of receipt of the statement.
 
 If you are not present at pick up within 5 minutes of your child’s dismissal time, there will be a late pickup
 charge of $5.00 for the first 5 minutes and an additional $1.00 per minute thereafter.
 
 A late charge of $15.00 is due if your monthly payment is not received on time. A $35.00 fee will be charged to
 your account for each returned check/NSF notice.
 
 Extended Day will not be available if there are any issues with the physical location, the school is closed due to
 weather, or if an emergency situation or necessity were to arise.

 Illness Policy
 
 IMPORTANT NOTICE: In an effort to mitigate the spread of illness, we ask that parents agree to be diligent and
 forthcoming with information so that we may prioritize the health and safety of all children and staff.
 
 *Evergreen Montessori reserves the right to make changes based upon CDC recommendations. Parents/guardians will
 be notified in writing immediately if any changes occur to this document.
 
 In order to prevent the spread of germs and provide comfort, a child showing signs of illness may not attend school.
 Therefore, your child must remain home, or will be sent home, for any one of the following conditions.
  • Fever - A temperature of 100 degrees. Child's temperature must be normal for 24 hours before returning to
  school.
  • Diarrhea - Child must be symptom free for a full 24 hours before returning to school.
  • Vomiting - Child must be symptom free for 24 hours before returning to school.
  • Severe upper respiratory illness - including congestion, constant uncontrolled nasal discharge, mucus in the
  eyes, colored mucus in the nose, severe uncontrolled productive cough (raising phlegm).
  • Any lesion, wound, or skin rash with bleeding or oozing of clear fluid or pus - A child may be returned when:
  (1.) a health care provider signs a note stating that the condition is not contagious, and
  (2.) the area can be covered by a bandage without any drainage through the bandage.
  • Mouth sores with drooling
  • Severe injury
  • Any condition which appears to need medical attention, which keeps a child from participating comfortably in
  usual activities, or which requires one-on-one care.
 
  IMPORTANT NOTICE: Please report the following to Evergreen Montessori so that we may inform the parents of
  the other children of a possible outbreak.
 
  • Skin infections or rashes – these may include but are not limited to ringworm, impetigo, measles, chicken pox,
  herpes, etc.
  • Communicable diseases – these may include but are not limited to measles, tuberculosis, whooping cough, etc.
  which are reportable to the Department of Public Health
  • Head Lice, Scabies or other infestations
  • Conjunctivitis (""pink eye"") - with white or yellow discharge.
 
 The final decision as to whether a child may attend school or should to be excluded from an event is made by the
 Director(s). We may request that a doctor's release be obtained before the child returns to school.
 
 Medication
 Prescription or over the counter medication can only be administered when accompanied by a completed Medication
 Log, as stated in 55 Pa. Code 3270.133; 3280.133; and 3290.133, providing parent permission to a caretaker to
 administer the medication. A new medication log must be filled out, signed and dated for each separate medication or a
 new time period.
 
  • Prescription medication - If medicine is a ""prescribed"" medication from a doctor, it must be in the prescription
  bottle and labeled with the child's name, the time to be administered, and the dosage amount. Medication
  labeled for someone else cannot be given to your child.
  • Over the counter medication - If medication is an over-the-counter medication, then clear directions must be
  printed on the label appropriate to the age of the child.
 Practices, Policies, and Procedures related to illnesses
 
 If your child becomes sick at school:
 
 All students will be observed throughout the day. If your child exhibits or communicates symptoms or conditions, then
 we will follow the protocol listed below:
 
  1. Parents/guardians will be contacted immediately.
  2. Your child will be made comfortable in a designated area where they can be appropriately separated from all
  other students and asked to put a mask on. A staff member will have eye contact and direct supervision of your
  child until they are picked up.
  3. CDC guidelines for cleaning and disinfecting the area where the child was working will be followed.
  4. Staff will clean and disinfect all surfaces in the area where the child was separated and resting once the sick child
  has gone home.
 
 Isolation
 
 Remain home while a fever and symptoms persist.
 
 Ending Isolation
 
  1. You can go back to your normal activities when, for at least 24 hours, both are true:
  a. Your symptoms are getting better overall, and
  b. You have not had a fever (and are not using fever-reducing medication).
  2. When you go back to your normal activities, take added precaution over the next 5 days, such as taking
  additional steps for cleaner air, hygiene, masks, physical distancing, and/or testing when you will be
  around other people indoors. This is especially important to protect people with factors that increase their risk
  of severe illness from respiratory viruses.
 
 Wearing a Mask
 
 Your child may be asked to wear a mask if they are exhibiting symptoms such as persistent coughing, sneezing,
 or runny nose that they are having a difficult time managing.
 
 If an illness is confirmed in a child or staff member:
 
  1. The areas used by the child or staff member will be closed off.
  2. Outside doors and windows will be opened to increase air circulation in the areas.
  3. All areas used by the person, such as offices, bathrooms, and common areas will be cleaned and disinfected.
  4. The directress will inform parents/guardians of enrolled children when there is a suspected outbreak of a
  communicable disease or an outbreak of an unusual illness that represents a public emergency according to the
  Department of Health as per 55 Pa. Code 3270.136(b), 3280.136 (b), and 3290.136 (b).

 Discipline
 Positive Discipline Guidelines
 
 Evergreen Montessori is committed to providing a supportive and nurturing learning environment where young children
 can grow and achieve their maximum potential. We appreciate each child’s unique qualities and characteristics, and we
 follow each child's individual chronological development.
 
 We believe ""discipline"" is a teaching and learning experience, not a punishment. As situations for social and behavioral
 growth occur, the teacher will facilitate resolution and encourage problem-solving on the part of the children involved.
 “Doing the right thing” and “The Golden Rule: Treat others the way you would want them to treat you” are our guiding
 principles here at Evergreen Montessori.
 
 The following guidelines are used when teaching children to take responsibility for their actions:
 
  1. Set realistic expectations for young children's behavior.
  2. Create a prepared environment that contributes to appropriate behavior.
  3. Model and encourage positive communication techniques.
  4. Assist children in exploring alternatives for constructive problem-solving.
  5. Teach children to use their words appropriately and take responsibility for the role they assumed in the situation.
  6. Use natural and logical consequences.
 Preschool Daily Schedule
 Children like predictable routines, so we follow the same schedule every day. The times are slightly flexible to
 accommodate the activities of the day.

 Circle Time
 All children will sit quietly in a circle with the teacher. We begin by reviewing the calendar (the season, weather for the
 day, and date). Music follows our calendar time as we sing songs and engage in finger plays and movement activities.
 Periodically, we bring out beanbags and simple instruments (rhythm sticks, triangles, drums, etc.) to accompany the
 songs. Our songs assist in teaching concepts such as days of the week, months of the year, letter sounds, animal sounds,
 sharing, feelings, colors and shapes, rhythms, or any other conceptual theme we may be integrating into our curriculum
 that week. Circle time ends with a story or reading several poems, discussing the content, and asking comprehension
 questions.
 
 Character Building:
 Two main resources that Evergreen Montessori incorporates into our daily character-building program are: “Honoring
 the Light of the Child” and “Nurturing the Spirit”.
 
 Our small group readings, discussions, songs, and activities are primarily concerned with developing each child’s social-
 emotional skills and nurturing their inner spirit. A different character-building theme will be addressed each month
 throughout the school year. Each week, the teacher will lead her group through one of many structured activities
 focused on a particular theme. These activities are designed to provide children with the tools necessary for living a
 balanced and healthy life. Monthly themes include topics such as: “Honoring the Light Within”, cooperation, self-
 confidence, conflict resolution skills, empathy, gentleness, respect, self-control, freedom, honesty, humility, love, peace,
 responsibility, simplicity, tolerance, and unity.
 
 Gross Motor Development
 Indoor/outdoor play is another important time in each child's day. During this time, they get to develop their strength,
 coordination, and body awareness by engaging in a variety of activities, which includes but is not limited to throwing and
 catching, running, jumping, crawling, hula hooping, playing hopscotch, participating in imaginary play and organized
 sports. Additionally, they can socialize with their peers and increase their communication skills.
 Snack Time and Lunch
 Evergreen Montessori is focused on assisting in the development of the whole child which means setting the stage for
 establishing healthy habits socially, emotionally, physically, spiritually, and academically. By teaching children healthy
 eating habits from an early age, we may have a positive impact on their physical growth and development. This should
 help decrease the risk of future health problems that are directly related.
 
 Snack
 At Snack Time, we ask that you pack your child fruits, vegetables, healthy snacks, and water. We encourage the
 avoidance of foods high in sugar and fat. We ask each parent to provide their child with a daily snack. Each day should
 consist of two different snack options, one prepared snack and one that requires some basic food preparation that the
 child can engage in themself. Snack options are listed below.
 
 Children may choose to have their snack at any point during Montessori time when they are hungry. A snack table will
 be set up for the children so they may independently prepare their plate and eat their snack.

 apologize not being able to care for your child at this moment. I’ve been
 getting a lot of calls from people who Daycare is just closed unexpectedly and
 that’s very sad but the reason is it’s because of the funding they cut them all
 off and those who cannot sustain themselves are forced to close their doors. I’m
 so sorry that happened to you. If I didn’t have PT twice a week, I would’ve
 asked you if you don’t mind me not able to walk as much affecting your child. My

 Are you looking for all day care? We are just a preschool program here at HMNS.
 Our three year old program runs Tuesday-Thursday mornings from 8:45-11:15. If
 this works for your family, please let me know. If you need all day childcare,
 our school would not be an option for you, and I hope you are able to find
 something that works for you!!

 I am so sorry to hear about the unexpected closing of your center. That is

  Moose Alley Daycare Parent Informational Packet
 Thank you for your interest in Moose Alley Daycare. This packet contains some helpful
 information about our daycare center. Upon enrollment, a parent handbook will be provided to
 you with our full policy and procedures.
 A Little About Moose Alley Daycare
 Located at 99 Bailey Hill Rd in Poland, Moose Alley Daycare LLC was first established in June
 of 2022 as the daycare and property was purchased by new owners Ashlie & Andrew Gagnon.
 Ashlie & Andrew, along with our Director Renee Lancaster and our team of dedicated staff,
 worked to ensure that the need for high quality childcare was met in our small town. We are a
 family owned and run business. We are happy to serve our community and our area children and
 look forward to working with you to provide a secure foundation for your child to ensure
 successful growth and learning. We are licensed to care for children up to 31 children, ages 6
 weeks to 12 years old. We are open from 7am-5pm Monday to Friday. We believe that children
 being outside and enjoying nature is beneficial in an abundance of ways. We strive to incorporate
 many outdoor activities into our curriculum.
 Our REMOVEDion Statement
 Nurturing your child is the most important part of the Moose Alley Daycare program. We will
 provide encouragement, and enriching experiences. Nurturing your child means showing
 support, help, concern, and understanding-all things that are part of the special closeness between
 a caregiver and your child. We believe that play is a vital part of a child’s development. Our
 daycare program encourages creative play. There are opportunities for independent play and
 group play, as well as a mixture of both structured and unstructured time, both inside and
 outside. We provide the ability to develop fine motor and gross motor skills and encourage
 different activities to promote both skill sets.
 At Moose Alley Daycare children learn how to behave appropriately with other children. They
 learn to socialize and how to process and handle their emotions. Effective guidance helps
 children to get along with others and teaches children how to deal with their own feelings in
 acceptable, appropriate ways. This helps promote security and a positive self-concept. Moose
 Alley Daycare provides your child with a relaxed, safe atmosphere in which to develop, learn,
 and grow. We challenge each child to grow and develop at their own pace by exposing them to
 concepts that help them to understand their world. We believe that children learn through a
 variety of experiences. Some of these activities should be consistent in their day, and some
 should be different for variety and interest. We believe that the best childcare depends on
 consistent caregiving in a home-like atmosphere. Children grow and learn best in a safe
 environment that provides opportunities to explore, create and communicate with other children
 and adults. These groups function independently but cooperatively, following routines
 appropriate to individual needs. The program is designed to be inclusive of all children,
 including those with identified disabilities, special learning and developmental needs.
 Non-Discrimination Policy
 It is the policy of Moose Alley Daycare not to discriminate based on race, color, religion (creed),
 gender, gender expression, age, national origin (ancestry), disability, marital status, or sexual
 orientation, on any of its activities or operations. We are committed to providing an inclusive and
 welcoming environment for all members of our staff, children and families we serve, and
 volunteers. We follow all laws set forth by the ADA and are a fully accessible daycare center.
 Enrollment Procedures
 Before your child is enrolled, you will be asked to tour the facility, and stay for a period, once or
 twice, depending on how your child reacts to their new environment. Once your child is enrolled,
 we ask that you complete the enrollment packet and return all the paperwork, including
 up-to-date immunization records, by the first day of attendance. Each of these forms is required
 by the State of Maine for licensing standards. Please notify the program of any changes to your
 child’s information as soon as possible.
 We require a non-refundable deposit (equal to one week's payment) in order to hold your child's
 spot. Your child will not be enrolled, and the spot will not be considered filled until deposit is
 received. Payment will be applied he deposit to your child’s first week of care when they attend.
 If you are on a waitlist, you do not need to pay a deposit until the spot is offered to you. Upon the
 offer, you would then need to pay the deposit to secure the spot.
 Licensing requires that immunization records be kept on file and up to date for all children
 enrolled.
 **Anytime your child goes to the doctor’s office and has shots, please bring an updated
 immunization record to add to your child’s file or have them emailed/faxed to us.**
 For a list of mandatory vaccines for your child to attend daycare please visit:
 https://www.maine.gov/dhhs/mecdc/infectious-disease/immunization/documents/Daycare-Immu
 nization-standards-revised.pdf
 We ask that each child bring:
 - Their immunization records. These can also be faxed to us directly from the physician’s office
 to 207-998-2109 or emailed to moosealleydaycare@gmail.com We must have immunization
 records within 30 days of enrollment.
 - All completed enrollment packed paperwork.
 - 2 full sets of extra clothes (Weather appropriate and including socks!)
 -diapers/wipes if your child is not toilet trained
 -bottles/formula/breastmilk/jarred baby food if appropriate for your child.
 -LUNCH DAILY (we provide morning and afternoon snack and drink)
 -Water bottle to keep at daycare(if over 1) if under 1, a sippy cup is great! This will be labeled
 and only used by your child.
 -children over 18 months-blanket for rest time/small pillow, small stuffy or comfort item. Rest
 time items will be sent home at the end of each week and should be returned the following week
 washed.
  Classrooms
 Infant Classroom
 Our infant classroom schedule is based on each individual infant's needs, abilities, and emotions.
 We provide a creative and stimulating environment that promotes visual, language, gross motor,
 and small motor experiences to enhance learning through each infant's own natural curiosity. At
 each stage of development, our experienced infant teacher will guide your child, and provide
 loving care along the way. Our teacher provides parents with a daily report on each infant's
 activities throughout the day(bottles, diaper changes, feedings etc).
 Toddler Classroom
 The toddler classroom is designed to provide stimulating experiences where toddlers can learn
 through their own inquisitiveness, and emphasizes building self-confidence, learning to navigate
 emotions, building friendships, and fostering the natural curiosity that toddlers have. Our daily
 lesson plans promote art/sensory experiences, music, gross motor, fine motor, and science skills.
 We have indoor play and outdoor play daily. Our teacher guides and gently directs our toddlers to
 explore their surroundings through positive and comforting interactions, activities, and fun
 playtime.
 Preschool Classroom
 Our preschool program provides children with plenty of opportunities for expanding their social
 skills, vocabulary, team building, caring, all while learning their academics in a fun and exciting
 manner! They will spend their day actively learning in the creative arts area, sensory table,
 reading corner, using manipulative in creative building, pretend play in kitchens and dress-up
 costumes, and so much more! Our preschool daily schedule includes circle time, center play,
 language arts, math, science, and sensory exploration along with outdoor play. Children in this
 classroom follow a predictable routine and participate in community jobs in their classroom.
 School Age Classroom
 The school age program is for children who attend school full time (kindergarten through
 elementary grades). Our school age program gives children a safe and fun space to play and learn
 before and after school. During school vacations students participate in fun activities that help to
 support both their social and academic growth.

 We currently have one MWF space available, but there is a family that has

 If they do secure that spot, it’s nearly impossible to predict when another

 All of our classes are half-day and part-time. Parents of our three-year-olds
 choose either a two-day (T/TH) OR three-day (MWF) morning class that meets from
 8:45-11:45 am. There is currently a spot available in one of our

 We offer early drop-off at 8:15 am, and there is an option to extend the threes'
 day by participating in our lunch group meeting from 11:45 am-1:15 pm on the
 days your child attends class.
 Would our offerings work for your little one and family? If so, I would love to

 response to your inquiry regarding the availability of a position for our three
 year old classroom, we unfortunately do not have any openings at this time as
 the classroom is full. Availability is dependent on a family withdrawing or

199b64733f6d98ca,"Good Evening REMOVED,
 Currently our 3s room is at capacity and we are looking at anywhere from 6-12
 months for new families to get enrolled in that age group. If we would have a
 family terminate care then there could be a potential for a new child to start.
 Our waitlist is at a low for that age group so your best option if you would
 want to continue with the process would be to place a $50 nonrefundable deposit
 down and fill out a waitlist form. That $50 fee would reserve your spot if a
 spot were to become available.
 Thank you!

199b9d3787289701,"Good morning REMOVED,
 
 Thank you for your interest in Carmelite Child Development Center!
 
 I am so sorry to hear this news!
 
 The first step is to get your child on our Wait List. You can either pick one up
 during our business hours of 7:30am – 5:15pm, pick one up during a tour if we
 schedule one, or I can email one to you as well; whichever is more convenient
 for you.
 
 You mentioned your child is 3 years old. When is his/her birthday?
 
 Is he/she completely potty trained? Meaning…. Can he/she can use the bathroom by
 him/herself, can pull down/up his/her underwear/shorts by themselves, and is in
 underwear 24/7? Please let me know.
 
 Please also give me an idea on if you’d be needing full or part time care.
 
 We currently have a Wait List for our 3-5 year old room, but I am in the process
 of calling families on it who are needing full time care first, then will reach
 out to those needing part time care after that, if space allows.
 
 If you would be interested in scheduling a tour to come see and hear all that
 Carmelite has to offer, I would be happy to set that up for you. Please just
 give me some days and times that would work for you!
 
 I look forward to hearing back from you!
 
 Have a blessed day,

199bfe14ab08fc32,"Hello REMOVED.
 Thank you for reaching out about our program and I'm sorry to hear about your
 daycare closing unexpectedly, that is stressful. Unfortunately, we do not
 currently have any placements available in our program.
 If placements become available we continue to fill them from our waiting list.
 In order to join our waiting list you will need to complete the Enrollment
 Application from our website. There is no fee to join our waiting list so I
 would encourage you to do so but to be fully transparent based on the length of
 our waiting list and how often we have openings mid-year the chances of getting
 to you with an offer this school year are quite slim.
 I do however invite you to attend our Open House event tomorrow, Wed 10/8, if
 you would like to learn more about our program. Your family is welcome to
 drop-in anytime between 3:30pm and 5:00pm on that day and children are, of
 course, welcome. During this event visitors will be welcome to visit some of our
 classrooms and will have an opportunity to speak with our Director and some of
 our Educators. Feel free to explore our outdoor spaces during your visit as
 well; we have a nature playground, a beautiful pond with a dock, plenty of green
 space, and some wooded nature trails beyond the upper meadow.
 Please let me know if you have additional questions.
 Thank you.
 Katie

 through our 2025-2026 school year, we are not expecting that to change unless
 one of our families makes a change and disenrolls their child. We can add you to
 a waitlist if you would like and we will give you a call you if anything changes
 or a spot becomes available.

 I’m so sorry to hear about your daycare’s unexpected closure—that’s a tough
 situation. We’d be happy to help and make this transition as smooth as possible
 for your family.
 
  Next steps
 
  1. Quick call & tour: We can meet as soon as tomorrow or Wednesday. Does 10:30
  AM or 4:30 PM either day work for you? If not, share a couple of times that
  do and I’ll accommodate.
 
  2. Availability: We have a space available in our 3-year-old classroom.
 
  3. Info to prepare (helps us move fast):
 
  * Child’s full name and date of birth
 
  * Best phone number to reach you
 
  What to bring to the tour (if you have them handy)
 
  * Florida immunization form DH 680 and physical DH 3040 (or your most recent
  records)
 
  * Photo ID for guardian
 
 We know you’re on short notice—our team will prioritize your visit and
 fast-track enrollment.
 
 Please reply with your preferred tour time (or call (407) 889-4300) and we’ll
 get everything set up.

 Hi! My name is Jennifer Mora and I own and operate Little Tot Stop Family Child
 Care. I currently have a few openings: all ages including infants.
 I would love to discuss your child care needs.
 So just a few bits of information about me and my day care.
 I have about 25 years experience in child care; nine years of that working at
 the school district in special education and the remainder doing in home child
 care. My major in school was child psychology and minor was early child hood
 studies, never completed them however cause I wanted to have kids.
 I am licensed for 14 childre but operate as a small child care so my ratio is
 1:6. My hours are 6am-6pm; Monday-Friday.
 We do a letter, shape, color, number and theme every week or two. Circle time,
 centers, outdoor play, indoor play and Friday fun.
 I have fur babies as well (dogs and a cat)
 My own children are now 18 and 14
 A three year old is $200 a week and my hours are 6a-6p.
 I have attached a few photos of currently enrolled kids as well

 is fully potty trained. When is the child's birthday? Depending on when she
 turned 3 will determine if we have full or part time available. We can schedule

  PARENT HANDBOOK
 
  ABOUT US
  We are locally owned and operated, child care center that is driven and inspired by our vision to provide the very best in
  infant care and early childhood education. We’ve carefully crafted every aspect of our business with the children, parents,
  and teachers at the forefront. That means we’re breaking the mold and delivering an innovative, chic, and modernized
  brand of child care.
  MISSION STATEMENT
  We want to partner with you to ensure the children get the most out of their school experience. By introducing children to
  play, art, and academics with an actively involved teacher to help ensure safe and high quality care. We recognize that
  every child learns and develops at their own pace, so our curriculum can be just as flexible to the child's level of interest
  helping create both equality and individualism.
  PHILOSOPHY (a)
  At LPLC we will focus on a developmental based program that is theTraditional Learning Style; where physical, cognitive,
  social and emotional aspects of learning will be encouraged. We will incorporate early beginnings of STEM which stands
  for science, technology, engineering and mathematics. With technology advancing and always changing in the works
  around us we want to introduce this in the early years to children. Learning these techniques through both hands-on and
  teacher led activities can help assure future success.
  We want our families and staff to be happy. We encourage strong teacher-parent relationships and child/teacher
  relationships in order to maintain a successful journey in their education. We will never stop learning, listening and
  imagining.

 Breastfeeding Friendly Child Care Family Policy
 Longs Peak Learning Center breastfeeding policy is as follows:
 
 Supportive Environment
  • We provide an atmosphere that welcomes breastfeeding families. We support mothers who continue to
  breastfeed their infants/children as they return and continue to work.
  • We have a private, designated space (other than the bathroom) available for mothers to breastfeed their children.
  We welcome mothers to breastfeed in the classroom as well.
  • We maintain a breastfeeding supportive environment through posting and providing culturally appropriate
  breastfeeding support materials (e.g. pictures, posters, etc.), not including those produced or supplied by
  commercial entities and/or manufactures of infant formula.
  • We “check-in” with mothers for feedback and ways to continue providing support.
  • Staff communicates the infant’s changing schedule (i.e., feeding, napping, etc.) so a mother can adjust her
  schedule for pumping and/or visiting to feed her infant.
 
 Initial Contact
 LPLC PARENT HANDBOOK – Rev 1/2025 - ©2017 Longs Peak Learning Center, Co. All Rights Reserved Page 5/19
  • We discuss breastfeeding support with all potential new families and share this policy and breastfeeding
  resources with them.
  • We work with parents prior to their first day in child care to transition the infant to bottle or cup feedings.
 
  Feeding and Handling Milk
  • Staff follows storage and handling of breast milk as defined by Colorado Department of Human Services
  regulations and Colorado Rules and Regulations Governing the Health and Sanitation of Child Care Facilities.
  • We discuss with all families how expressed milk is handled at our center.
  • Freezer space is available for milk storage.
  • Staff informs families on written procedures on the proper way to label and handle breast milk.
  • Staff coordinates with parents about the quantity of milk remaining in containers to avoid waste.
  • Staff fills bottles with less breast milk than necessary for a feeding. Staff will have additional breastmilk available

 a spot open up? Also, can we schedule an appointment with you to discuss?
 
 My REMOVED REMOVED and I look forward to hearing from you.

  Hello, thanks for reaching out. I have availability as soon as Tuesday,
  October 14. I could schedule a walk-through Monday at 3:30 PM if you would
  like. That is the only day/time I have available next week. As I am going on
  vacation. If you are interested in that, let me know and you fill out the
  information below!
  Hi, and thank you for your interest in Baby Steps ChildCare LLC. My address is
  1705 N Charlotte St, Appleton, WI 54911. My hours of operation are 7:30 AM to
  4:30 PM, Monday-Friday. Because I am fully licensed, my first aid and CPR
  certifications are up-to-date. I am not open on weekends. For you to secure a
  spot for your child, a walkthrough interview needs to occur. I am interviewing
  you as much as you are interviewing me during this time. My priority is the
  students I already have enrolled, so if I don’t think it’s a good fit, I will
  let you know. I do not offer sibling discounts because this is a licensed
  in-home daycare and my spots are limited. I require the first week’s rate to
  be paid upfront to secure a place. That is nonrefundable. Additionally, the
  annual registration fee of $125 needs to be paid. This fee is per child. This
  must be two weeks from the tour date and is non-refundable. Payment is
  accepted via cashier's check, state assistance, or the Brightwheel app. This
  is a comprehensive in-app. You get updates about what your kiddo eats, when
  they eat, when they go to the bathroom, etc. This app can collect payments.
  It’s very convenient for tax time as everything is in one place, in a
  printable form.
 
  I do accept state subsidies (Wisconsin shares). However, if you are in the
  process of getting approved for state subsidy, that can be a very lengthy
  process. I have seen it take up to 3 months to get approved. All fees must be
  paid on time and in full while you’re waiting to get approved for subsidy. I
  offer walk-throughs from 3:30 pm-4:30 pm, Monday through Friday. I do not
  offer after-hours or weekend times for walk-throughs. I provide all food, and
  I am part of a federal food program that follows strict regulations for
  nutrition. I teach a curriculum from Funshine and make my individualized
  learning plans to meet the child’s specific needs. One important thing I’d
  like to say is that I am a daycare that is fully licensed, and this is my
  business. Think of a “normal” daycare but just in a house. I am a teacher who
  has extensive training, and I have a degree in early childhood education. I am
  not a babysitter. The children enrolled with me are my highest priority, and
  their safety and education are my job. At the bottom of this email, you will
  find a local resource that helps guardians pay for daycare depoists, plus my
  add on Care.com. Please note that I do not allow any electronic devices like
  phones or tablets (for child entertainment )to be brought at any time. If you
  are interested, please send me the following BEFORE REQUESTING A WALK
  THROUGH:
 
  · Child's full legal name
 
  · Date you are looking for care to start (this needs to be specific)
 
  · Times that drop off and pick up will happen.
 
  · All parents or guardians' full legal name(s)
 
  · Child's DOB:
 
  · Child's gender:
 
  · Address:
 
  · Best phone number(s) and email address(s) to reach both parents (if
  applicable):
 
  · Allergies or special diets (I have 2 dogs and one cat and we are NOT
  a nut-free household. If you have allergies to certain perfumes or scents this
  daycare will not work for you. ):
 
  · Behavioral issues (if applicable):
 
  · Educational goals you have for the child:
 
  · Does your child nap? If so, what times are they normally napping and for
  how long?:
 
  · Does your child drink breastmilk or formula or both? (if applicable):
 
  · Date and time you are hoping to do a walkthrough (this needs to be
  confirmed):
 
  · ANY medical issues? (This could even be as simple as a recurring diaper
  rash, etc.):
 
  · Is your child considered special needs?:
 
  * Has your child attended daycare before? Name of center?:
  Are you paying yourself or with a subsidy?:
 
  · Anything additional you would like to share with me?

 Thank you for reaching out. I have attached our school brochure to this reply.
 It contains information about our preschool and should answer most of your
 questions. Currently our center is completely full with a waiting list in all of
 our classrooms. If you would like to be added to the waiting list, I need your
 child's full name and date of birth, along with your contact information. Our
 list is quite long- so know the wait may take a while. The three year old
 waitlist has approx. 30 families on that list.
 
 Let me know if you have any further questions.
 
 Have a great day.

199a4f7202ce2f52,"Hi REMOVED,
 
 Thank you for reaching out, and I’m so sorry to hear about the sudden closure of
 your daycare. I completely understand how stressful that can be for families.
 
 We would love the opportunity to connect with you and REMOVED about care for your
 three-year-old. At this time, we have limited spots for a three year old and I
 currently have several enrollment packets that I am going through and packets
 that have been picked up. We work on a first come, first serve basis. Families
 that have all of their paperwork completed and payment in place receive first
 priority in the order that they are received. That being said, we don't
 currently have a waitlist for 3 year olds unless any of the packets I am working
 on have 3 year olds or we have new ones turned in. We also have two different
 classrooms for 3 year olds. One is a transition room for those that are not
 fully potty trained and the other is for those that are fully potty trained. We
 also place kids in their classes dependent on development.
 
 I’d be happy to schedule a tour and conversation with you. Would you be
 available tomorrow (Friday) between 10am-2pm (you will get to see more of
 the classroom activity between 10am and 12pm)? If that time frame doesn't work,
 let me know your availability, and we’ll find a time that does.
 
 We look forward to meeting your family soon!

199aacc5b171e358,"Hello REMOVED,
 
 Thank you for your interest in Silverspot for your child. Our school operates
 year-round, starting in mid-August and ending in the last week of July.
 
 As a parent participation school, our member families play an active role in our
 play based, educational community. Families are required to contribute by
 working as classroom aides once a week to ensure our 1:5 ratio. There are also
 other school-related responsibilities like attending monthly meetings and
 assisting with school maintenance. Our school is governed by a board of
 directors elected by the membership each spring. The responsibility of being a
 classroom aide can be fulfilled by any family member, including grandparents,
 aunts, and uncles. We also have current and alumni members who are willing to
 work for a family who needs help with classroom shifts for pay. We are offering
 a non-participation option for full time students to support families who are
 unable to participate in the classroom. We limit it to 5 families a year for
 $1900 a month. At Silverspot, we emphasize the importance of both the child and
 their family, as we believe that a collective effort contributes to the growth
 of our little learners. For the past two decades, we've had the privilege of
 nurturing this approach within the vibrant city of Brisbane.
 
 Our enrollment is currently full for our morning program but we do have room in
 our extended care which runs 1pm-5pm. You are welcome to tour and I have one
 coming up on Monday the 6th at 11:30am or 2pm and you can bring your child with
 you. Once you feel that Silverspot aligns with your family's needs, we'll be
 delighted to provide you with an application. To streamline the enrollment
 process, we utilize the Brightwheel school platform for online submission of
 enrollment and fees. We look forward to meeting you soon and wish you a
 wonderful day ahead!
 
 Kindly,
 
 Diana Ji

 I’m so sorry to hear that you lost childcare. As a working parent myself, I know
 how hard that can be.
 
 We currently have openings for a three-year-old at both our Clever location
 (Little Blue Jay Training Academy) and our Nixa location (The Adventures of
 Learning Academy). We’d love to chat with you about setting up a tour or
 answering any questions you might have.
 
 Is our Little Blue Jay location in Clever the closest option for you?

 My center is small, family inspired and personalized. We are open M-F 6:45am to
 5:30pm. We have individual rooms full of activity! Circle time, songs, art,
 music & movement, sensory and social play - just to name a bit. We go outdoors
 twice a day as well.
 My first opening would be anything 26 hours per week or more. I am super
 flexible too. I’m assuming your son is familiar with routines if he’s been in
 day care as well.
 Feel free to check out our face book page to see what we’ve been up too!

 to an agency transition from REMOVEDissippi Action for Progress (MAP) to Pearl

 have availability beginning on Monday. You guys are welcome to come tour

  Welcome to Our Home Preschool and Child Care Family
 
 Program
 
 RNCC cares for children ages six-weeks to five years old. Care is provided Monday through Friday 7:30 am– 5:30 pm. Child
 Care provided after 5:30 pm will be charged $1.00 per minute per child, unless other arrangements have been agreed upon.
 
 RNCC is a three-teacher team that offers infant care, toddler care and a full preschool program preparing children with
 social and emotions skills, as well as, kindergarten readiness.
 
 Payments/Fees
 
  * Full- Time Care
 
 $287/week Infants 6 weeks – 2 years.
 
 $271/week Toddlers 2 years – 3 years
 
 $221/week Preschoolers 3 years (& potty trained) – 5 years
 
  * Drop-in Care $60/day
 
  * A curriculum fee of $150 per child 1 year old and above is collected each August for curriculum, books and supplies
  for the school year.
 
  * Activity fees may apply for planned field trips throughout the year and are collected at the time of activity or
  field trip.
 
  * An enrollment fee equal to two weeks of care is collected to hold enrollment longer that 3 weeks’ time. This fee
  will secure your enrollment at RNCC and is non-refundable.
 
  * A two-weeks deposit is collected at time of enrollment that is applied to your ending two weeks of care at RNCC.
 
  * Payments are made through direct deposit through Union Bank. Payment plans are set up on an individual basis.
  Payments can be made on a weekly, bi-weekly or monthly schedule and are collected prior to caregiving. If your
  payment schedule needs to be changed, a 30 days’ notice is needed, and a new contract will need to be signed. To
  secure enrollment for your child, payment is due regardless of absences.
 
  * Child care fees are reviewed annually and are subject to an increase according to cost of living increases and/or
  business costs.
 
 Enrollment Policy
 
 E Shape2 very family taking an interest in RNCC is treated with respect and dignity. The first phone conversation will
 determine if the program services meet the needs of the family and determine if an interview should be scheduled to meet
 the provider and tour the program. The initial interview is scheduled to meet the provider and tour the program. The
 parents will receive the family handbook and enrollment papers. At that point, if RNCC is a good fit for your family,
 you will receive the child care contract and an enrollment fee or two-week deposit will be collected to secure your
 enrollment at RNCC. Enrollment positions are not held until an enrollment fee or deposit is received. It is ultimately
 up to the provider to decide if a family is a good fit for the program and the provider will make the final decision on
 if a child is enrolled.
 
 Arrival/Departure:
 
 Please send your children in clothes appropriate for the season. Please do not send toys, food, or drinks in with your
 children. Only authorized persons will be allowed to pick up your children. If there is a change in the person picking
 up your child you may inform me through a phone call or text, a photo ID may be required. If you are present, you are
 solely responsible for the supervision and safety of your child at RNCC.

 Curriculum
 
 Continuity of care is essential for infants and young children to build strong attachments with adults. This connection
 is important in establishing young children’s capacity to learn and grow. RNCC provides age-appropriate experiences for
 all children that are planned around the child’s developmental abilities. The curriculum we use is Gee Whiz and meets
 the criteria of the Nebraska Early Learning Guidelines. These areas of learning are language & literacy. at, science,
 creative arts, social & emotional development, and health & physical development. Our “school year” runs from September
 to May. In August, a curriculum fee of $150 is collected for each child aged 1 year and over.
 
 Six Core Values at RNCC
 
  * E Shape4 ncourage children as they grow and develop a love for God and his word.
 
  * Support culture differences at RNCC by showing respect and being open-minded to other points of view.
 
  * Guide children in a way that allows them to learn and grow at their own pace.
 
  * Understand that children learn best by using positive hands-on experiences in their daily activities.
 
  * Use positive guidance techniques that encourage children by showing dignity, building self-worth, and supporting
  individual uniqueness.
 
  * Creating partnerships with families by being responsive to their needs and providing support to families to meet the
  needs of the children.
 
 Partnerships with Parents
 
 RNCC is committed to providing an environment where the child, family, and provider work as a team toward individual
 goals resulting in a quality learning environment. Communication between parent and provider is essential to providing
 the best possible care for children. Please notify your provider of any concerns, schedule changes, if your child will
 be dropped off or picked up at a time different than their normal schedule or any other information you think would be
 necessary to share regarding the care or well-being of your child.
 
 Shape5 Partnership Plan
 
 Your provider is committed to:
 
 1. Study and understand her childhood culture and the culture she is made for her own immediate family.
 
 2. Be open-minded about parental comments and behaviors that differ from what she believes. Incorporate parental
 preferences, family values and cultures at RNCC as much as possible.
 
 3. Have casual conversations daily with parents about their child’s day, providing a daily sheet of the activities done
 each day and scheduling regular meetings with parents to discuss their child’s care and well-being.
 
 Philosophy of Caring for Young Children
 
 The goal of RNCC is to be responsive to the needs of families by collaborating with them, as well as providing support
 to them to meet the needs of each child. Providing continuity of care, a safe and loving environment and being sensitive
 to individual needs to build trusting relationships with each child. By understanding how children develop and offer
 daily learning experiences to maximize growth for all children. And, to help build self-worth by encouraging children’s
 involvement in activities and tasks throughout their daily experiences.
 
 Philosophy of Guidance and Discipline
 
 Definition of Discipline: Guidance that helps develop self-control, done with children, focuses on positive learning,
 promotes self-esteem, an active process, often based on preparation or anticipation, focuses on behavior, and encourages
 growth.
 
 RNCC Expectations:
 
 BE KIND: All children are encouraged to be nice to one another and acknowledge others’ feelings.
 
 BE SAFE: All children are encouraged to be safe with their bodies and others around them as they play, use equipment and
 furniture throughout their day.
 
 BE NEAT: All children are encouraged to help with clean-up after playing and other activities done throughout the day
 before moving on to something new.
 
 Infants
 
 I Shape6 nfants are redirected as much as possible without losing sight of the teachable moments the situation poses.
 When an infant is in danger or harming another child, they will be removed from the situation. At this age RNCC focuses
 more on positive behavior rather than unwanted behavior.
 
 Example: An infant is reaching for an outlet, and I would say, “Ouch! That will hurt you.” then take their hand and
 re-direct them to a toy that would allow them to do a similar activity like sticking things in a slot or hole.
 
 Toddlers
 
 Redirection is used as much as possible without losing sight of the teachable moments the situation poses. Continual
 unwanted behavior of a toddler will be managed by removal of the problem toy or object and/or losing the privilege to be
 part of the activity or play that is happening. This may be done by setting the child alone to play by themselves for a
 while or sitting in the safe seat. When a toddler is in danger or harming another child, they will be removed from the
 situation immediately.
 
 Preschoolers
 
 Every child is guided through the day with positive reinforcement in all activities, always encouraged to do their best.
 Unwanted behavior is managed by stating what is seen, helping children recognize their feelings, how to manage them
 appropriately and what they could do differently next time. Focusing on positive behavior helps children gain and keep a
 positive self-image. Aggressive or harmful behavior is managed by removing the child from the situation, allowing the
 child time to ‘cool off’ and then talking about what happened, how they can do better next time and role playing.
 Sitting in the safe seat and/or loss of privileges like playing with others or doing group activities may be necessary
 if a child is not able to be kind to others around them or follow directions.
 
 Nap Time/ Quiet time:
 
 Nap time/quiet time is between the hours of 12:00 pm – 2:30 pm. Nap/quiet time is required for all children in care at
 RNCC. Children do not have to fall asleep but are encouraged to have a rest period each day. Please avoid arrival and
 departure during these times. If arrival and/or departure is necessary during nap time hours please make arrangements
 with us ahead of time.
 
 Potty Training:
 
 We are happy to help with potty-training when your child shows signs of potty-training readiness. Some good indications
 of potty-training readiness are, interested in wanting to use the potty, can communicate toileting needs, stays dry for
 longer periods of time (2-3 hours), has a predictable toileting schedule, seems uncomfortable with wet or dirty diapers,
 can pull pants down and up, can follow basic directions.
 
 We ask parents to be 100% on board in helping with potty training to keep things consistent for the child at home and at
 daycare. Parents will need to provide diapers or pull-ups for their children during nap time based on the child’s needs.
 Children must be accident free for one month, including nap time before wearing underwear alone and be considered
 potty-trained.
 
 Parent Grievance
 
 Every parent of RNCC has the right to express their opinions and concerns regarding all aspects of their involvement
 with the program. RNCC encourages parents to communicate their concerns, as well as review the “Parent Handbook for
 Family Child Care Homes” from the Nebraska Health and Human Services System. RNCC is dedicated to seeking resolution of
 any concern or grievance and to provide the best care possible for each child individually with the child’s best
 interest in mind.
 
 Holidays
 
 The following are days RNCC is closed with pay:
 
 N Shape7 ew Year’s Day, Good Friday, Provider Appreciation Day (Friday before Mother’s Day), Memorial Day, Independence
 Day, Labor Day, Thanksgiving Day, Black Friday, December 24^th – January 1^st. Holidays that fall on a Saturday will be
 observed on the previous Friday and Holiday’s that fall on a Sunday will be observed on the following Monday.
 
 Teacher Resource/Training Days
 
 RNCC will be closed the last Friday each month for teacher resource days. Adjustments may be made when resource days
 fall around a holiday. These days will be included on our “Days Off” Sheet. In addition, if a required training falls on
 a week day, we will be closing so we can attend these training courses. These days will also be listed on the time off
 sheet. Payment will still be collected on these days and alternative care for your children will be required.
 
 Inclement Weather Days
 
 RNCC will be CLOSED for inclement weather following the SCC closings. Inclement Weather Days are when SCC has no classes
 due to the weather conditions. Payment would still be collected for inclement weather days. If SCC closes due to weather
 conditions, I will notify you by posting on our private Facebook page and through our family text threads. You would
 need to find alternative care for your children for that day or stay safe and warm in your homes.
 
 Vacation
 
 We close for one week each year for family vacation and tuition is still collected. We try to plan out our vacation days
 at least six months at a time or for the whole year, if possible, to give you as much time as we can to make alternate
 child care arrangements and/or plan your vacation at the same time. We will provide you with a “Days off sheet” at the
 beginning of each calendar year. Any adjustment to the DOS will be given with at least a 30-day notice.
 
 Funeral Leave
 
 One to five paid days for funeral leave is given in the case of the death of a member of my immediate family or close
 friend. This includes my spouse, children, parents, siblings, grandchildren, the spouse of any of these relatives, or a
 person who was similarly related to my spouse (in-laws) and close friends. Depending on when funeral arrangements are
 made, travel time, etc. The number of days will be determined at the time of need. But God willing, we do not have to
 worry about such things.
 
 Substitute Care
 
 I Shape8 n the event your provider needs to be away from the child care premises, RNCC will do their best to provide a
 substitute caregiver for the care of your child. Substitute caregivers are designated people that are approved by the
 Nebraska Child Care Licensing Department. Meeting substitute caregivers can be arranged by request. Substitute
 caregivers have a background check and are approved by DHHS for the safety of your child. Notices will be given when a
 substitute is used in place of Robin.
 
 Meals
 
 R Shape9 NCC provides breakfast, AM snack, lunch, and PM snacks that meet or exceed the guidelines of the Family Service
 Food Program. RNCC offers Target brand formula for infants up to twelve months of age. If your infant requires a special
 kind of formula, you may provide that for your infant. RNCC will provide infants aged 8 months up to their first
 birthday with pureed fruits & vegetables in addition to their formula. Individual food plans will be made between the
 parents and RNCC. Please do not send food with your child unless you have a child on a special diet with a doctor’s note
 or are bringing snacks for everyone. Prayer is encouraged at meal times.
 
 Emergency Plans
 
 *For life-threatening emergencies, the provider will call 911 and the parents.
 
 *Severe weather; the provider will take children to laundry room in the basement and await direction from local weather
 specialists to determine when it is safe to resume normal activities. Six tornado drills are practiced each year.
 
 *Poison; the Provider will call poison control and the parents.
 
 * Shape10 Fire; the Provider will gather children, exit out the nearest door, and walk together across the street to our
 safe spot (Gary’s Tree), then the provider will call 911 and the parents. Twelve fire drills are practiced each year.
 
 Authorized Escort
 
 For the safety of your child, please let RNCC know if you plan to have someone other than yourself or authorized persons
 pick-up your child from daycare. RNCC will not allow anyone to pick up your child without your consent. At the first
 pick up of an unknown person, they will be required to show their ID so we can match that to the names on their list of
 people cleared for pick up.
 
 Transportation
 
 A Shape11 ll children being transported while in care at RNCC will use seat belts and/or use the appropriate car seat
 for their ages. Prior notification will be given for planned outings, and you will be asked to leave your child’s car
 seats in the morning. Please be sure your child has the correct car seat for their weight and age. It is RNCC
 responsibility as a child care professional to protect the safety of your child when in my care, as well as, leaving my
 care.
 
 Immunizations
 
 RNCC is required by the State of Nebraska to submit a statement certifying each child’s immunization records and to keep
 accurate up-to-date records in each child’s file. Please provide RNCC with a list of new immunizations as they occur.
 
 Supplies
 
 Personal items that your child is asked to bring to RNCC are:
 
  * D Shape12 iapers and/or pull-ups and Wipes.
 
  * 3 Bottles, if needed.
 
  * Pacifier, if needed.
 
  * Lotions, creams, sunscreens, and powders that you want for your child.
 
  * Change of clothes (especially needed during toilet training).
 
  * Blanket and pillow for naptime.
 
  * Appropriate hats, coats, foot ware for each season.
 
 We have a play-based program, this includes a lot of outside play time. Children can get messy when they play, please
 dress your children appropriately to allow children to play without restrictions.
 
 Child Abuse and Neglect
 
 It is the goal of RNCC to protect the health and safety of all children in this program. We are mandatory reporters and
 are required by law to report any suspicions of child abuse or neglect. You, as a parent, are also required by law to
 report any suspicions of child abuse or neglect. Effective communication between parents and provider is essential.
 
 Medications: Shape13
 
 RNCC does not administer medications unless it is required for medical needs such as asthma or severe food allergies. A
 separate agreement will be made for these kinds of situations and a doctor’s note is required. The following policy will
 be followed. Prescription and over-the-counter medicine to be administered by RNCC must be signed in the medication
 record, stating the times, amount of medicine to be given and how often your child needs to receive the medication. All
 medicine provided must be in the original container, clearly labeled with the child’s full name and directions for the
 proper amount (dosage) and times to be administered. Please be sure labels are readable and have the right doses listed
 for your child’s specific age.
 
 Exclusion Policy
 
 If the provider’s own children become ill, RNCC will contact you as early as possible for you to pick them up and find
 alternative childcare for that day. Ill children must be picked up within an hour.
 
 R Shape14 NCC has the responsibility to keep the spreading of illness to a minimum. RNCC consistently enforce our Health
 Policy.
 
 Children are excluded from daycare for the following symptoms:
 
  * Fever of 100.2 degrees or more (auxiliary reading/under the arm then add one degree for accuracy).
 
  * Vomiting.
 
  * Undiagnosed rash.
 
  * Draining of ears or open sores.
 
  * Any symptoms of possible infectious disease (such as red goopy eyes).
 
  * Two watery stools in a 24-hour period, or one uncontained bout.
 
  * A deep or chesty, or croupy, or constant cough, or wheezing
 
  * Mouth sores with drooling.
 
  * Misery with a cold. Including goopy, watery eyes, running nose, sore throat, or other physical symptoms.
 
  * Inability to cope in group situation because of not feeling well or feeling “under the weather.”
 
 Children need to stay home from daycare until:
 
  * Fever free for 24 hours without medication: 48 hours if they had more than one symptom.
 
  * Able to eat solids without vomiting.
 
  * Bowel movements must continue to be solid when returning.
 
  * 24 hours after the first dose of medication taken due to contagious illnesses with symptoms improving and no
  fever.
 
  The final decision whether to exclude a child from care is made by the child care provider.
 
 Notices
 
 A 30-day notice is required for the following:
 
 1. Termination of agreement by either party following the completion of a trial period. (In the case of violent, vulgar
 behavior toward the provider of either parent or child services will be terminated immediately.)
 
 2. Increases in payments and/or fees or change in payment schedule.
 
 3. Vacation time.
 
 4. New policies in the Parent Handbook.

 Happy to help!
 We are only a preschool, not a daycare- all of our classes are 2.5 hours. If
 you would let me know your child's birthdate, I can let you know what classes we
 have available as we group children within a 6-month range. The most number of
 days per week for 3-year-olds is 3 days.
 Once I know what classes he or she could fit into, then we can proceed with
 setting up a tour.
 Thanks so much.

 I am the principal of St. Ambrose and your message was forwarded to me. While

 all falls under the school.
 I am happy to meet with you. We may have a restriction on how many we can take

 ------ Attachment IMMUNIZATION POLICY.pdf -----
 Ethical Society Nursery School
 
 IMMUNIZATION POLICY
 
 State law requires that every child enrolled in a nursery school, preschool,
 or day care center must be adequately immunized according to the
 REMOVEDouri Immunization Schedule. This schedule is in compliance with the
 U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, Centers for Disease
 Control and Prevention, The AmREMOVEDn Academy of Pediatrics, and The
 AmREMOVEDn Academy of Family Physicians. For more information about
 required immunizations visit:
 
 https://health.mo.gov/living/wellness/immunizations/schoolrequirements.php
 
 Each parent must provide satisfactory evidence of required immunizations
 to the director who, in turn, must file an annual report of compliance. Your
 child’s pediatrician provides a report of vaccinations to you at each visit,
 and a copy of this form is adequate evidence of vaccination. Immunization
 information, signed by the child's doctor (by hand or electronically), must be
 on file in the Nursery School office before a child is allowed to enter
 school.
 
 The Ethical Society Nursery School Board will review cases of necessary
 medical exemptions and will potentially allow an unvaccinated child to
 attend school. Any other exemption to vaccinations is not allowed.
 
 Children who are on a delayed immunization schedule are required to
 submit the REMOVEDouri Department of Health “Immunizations in Progress” form
 with their immunization record. The Board will then review the child’s record
 and decide on eligibility to continue. (see statute below)
 Immunization in progress. Section 167.181, RSMo, provides that students may continue to attend
 school as long as they have started an immunization series and provide satisfactory evidence
 indicating progress is being accomplished. An original Department of Health and Senior
 Services’ form Imm.P.14 shall be completed and placed on file with the school immunization
 health record of each student with immunizations in progress. The Imm.P.14 form is
 incorporated by reference in this rule as published June 2012 by the Department of Health and
 Senior Services and may be obtained by contacting a medical provider, local public health
 agency, or the department’s Bureau of Immunization Assessment and Assurance at PO Box 570,
 Jefferson City, MO 65102-0570, or by calling 800-219-3224. This rule does not incorporate any
 subsequent amendments or additions. Failure to meet the next scheduled appointment constitutes
 noncompliance with the school immunization law and exclusion shall be initiated immediately.

  School Operations
 
 School Hours
 
 School hours are 8:45 am-11:45 am for all classes.
 
 The Yellow and Blue Room children attend school Monday through Friday. The 2 Day Green
 Room children are at school on Tuesday and Thursday. The 3 Day Green Room children attend
 Monday, Wednesday and Friday mornings.
 
 Visiting School
 
 Parents are a very important part of our school community and are welcome to visit school at
 any time.
 
 Lunch Bunch and Early Morning Care
 
 Lunch is offered everyday from 11:45 am until 2:15 p.m. Parents should send lunch and a drink
 with their student. The children will eat lunch together, and participate in free play and
 organized activities. They will also spend time outside on the playground, weather permitting.
 
 There is a discounted rate to the families that utilize the program more often. Please email
 staciezd@gmail.com if you are interested in signing up for Lunch Bunch.
 
 Early morning care starts at 8:15 a.m. and is offered every day.
 
 Drop Off and Pick Up Procedure
 
 In the interest of the children’s safety, parents and caregivers must use the following driving
 pattern when dropping off or picking up a student.
 
  1 All cars will enter via the WEST driveway.
  2 FOR THE YELLOW and BLUE ROOMS - Cars will then pull up next to the hedge that
  runs along the patio to meet the director/teacher for drop off or pick up.
  3 FOR THE GREEN ROOM – Cars will continue to the driveway leading up the EAST side
  of the building and stop at the gate to the steps to the patio.
  4 The passenger side of the car will be adjacent to the patio/porch sidewalk. Place the
  car in “PARK.” The director/teacher will open the passenger rear side door to help
  children in or out of the car.
  5 Cars will then pull forward and exit via the EAST driveway.
 
 At dismissal time, in order to keep the line moving as quickly as possible, please pull forward,
 adjacent to the playground, to buckle children’s seatbelts before exiting via the EAST driveway.
 
 3
 If parents wish to come into the school, they may park and escort their child across the parking
 lot, holding hands, to ensure their safety in the parking lot. We also ask that you stay OFF YOUR
 CELL PHONES in the parking lot. We all need to focus on student safety.
 
 Parents who find that they will be delayed in picking up their child are asked to call the school or
 text the director. Some children need reassurance and may become anxious when they see their
 friends leave while they are still waiting. We may take a child who is waiting to be picked up to
 the Lunch Bunch area to play with friends.
 
 Authorization to Leave School
 
 Please email the director, every time they are to go home with someone who does not usually
 drive them. This adult may be asked to provide identification. To ensure children’s safety, ESNS
 will not release a child to any individual without written permission from a parent.
 
 Snow Days / School Closings
 
 If driving is hazardous and it is necessary to close school, the director will send out a message
 on the Class Dojo messaging platform and send an email.
 
 The driveway at the Society can become slick and dangerous in cases of icy weather. If the
 Society closes for this reason, we must cancel school, and you will be notified as stated above.
 In the past, the building has been closed for water main breaks and lack of heat in the winter.
 The director will do her best to keep you informed and updated via text reminders, email and
 notifications on Class DoJo.
 
 Sickness
 
 ** If a child is not well, keep them home for their own sake and that of the other children. Per
 State requirements, we will not accept a sick child in our care. **
 
 We all want to keep children and teachers healthy. Please keep your child home when they:
 
  ● Have a fever or have had one during the previous 24 hours. A child should be fever free,
  without medication, for 24 hours before returning to school.
  ● Have a severe new cold with heavy nasal discharge or a constant cough.
  ● Are vomiting or have diarrhea.
  ● Need to be given medicine while at school.
  ● Are fussy, cranky, or exceptionally fatigued.
 
 We will follow CDC Covid guidelines. Please keep your child home for five days if they test
 positive for Covid and then they should wear a mask for five days. Teachers will follow the same
 guidelines. If we are all respectful and follow these rules we hopefully will not have to close a
 
 4
 classroom or the school down for an outbreak. We encourage everyone to stay up to date with
 Covid vaccinations. Any part of our COVID-19 Policy Information can be changed or updated at
 any time by the Board of Trustees.
 
 Please call or email when a child is sick. In turn, the school will inform parents of communicable
 diseases present in the different classrooms. A parent will be contacted if a child becomes sick
 at school and if they cannot be reached, the school will telephone the emergency contacts who
 have been designated for such a situation.
 
 Healthy procedures
 
 Hand-washing for all children is scheduled into the morning, beginning with drop-off.
 
 Teachers supervise children using hand sanitizer. Hand sanitizer is available in all classrooms,
 at the doorway to the office, and at health screening stations during drop off.
 
 ESNS continues to follow the state standards and protocols for cleaning, sanitizing, and
 disinfecting in an early childhood setting. The state required methods of cleaning and sanitizing
 is done before and after children eat at the classroom tables as well as when children use the
 tables for centers.
 
 Accidents/Injuries
 
 Each parent must grant authorization to the school to provide emergency medical care. If there
 is an accident and a child is injured, there will be an immediate attempt to contact the parent. If
 neither parent can be reached, the school will call the child’s pediatrician. In cases of serious
 injury or health crisis, 911 will be called first and parents second.
 Please keep the school informed of any changes in home, cell, or work telephone numbers or
 those of emergency contacts.
 
 Clothing
 
 ESNS encourages exploration and experiential learning which may include things like finger
 painting, mixing substances that have been dyed with food coloring, or hiking through the
 muddy woods at the bottom of the parking lot. Any number of activities may cause clothing to
 get dirty or stained. Please send your child in washable, sturdy play clothes. If possible, please
 label your child’s clothing.
 Children take care of themselves by pulling on/off their own shoes, jackets, or clothing to use
 the bathroom or change into dry clothes if there is a wet accident. This fosters independence
 and self-sufficiency. Children feel proud of themselves when they can take care of themselves in
 this manner and are capable of this responsibility. When considering clothing for school, avoid
 belts, overalls, dressy outfits, or items your child cannot begin to maneuver themselves.
 Outside play is very important for children. ESNS plays outdoors every day except when the
 weather is extremely cold or rainy. In winter, please send warm clothing. Layers work best.
 
 5
 Gloves, jackets, hats, and mittens should be labeled. It is better to have it and not need it than
 need it and not have it.
 
 Toys From Home
 
 Toys or possessions from home often make children feel more comfortable in the less familiar
 environment at school. Children in the Green Room programs are welcome to bring a “lovey”
 from home that may live in their backpack while at school. Blankets or a stuffed animal can be
 cuddled and kept safe in a backpack. Pacifiers should be left at home.
 In some classrooms, children get to bring a show-and-share item. Please avoid sending
 breakable or precious objects. Weapons, such as guns, sharp or pointed toys, umbrellas, money,
 gum or candy are not appropriate for school and will be kept in the office with the director until
 dismissal time. Visits from pets are very much enjoyed but please inform teachers ahead of
 time.
 
  Celebrations and Parent Involvement
 
 Classroom Snacks
 Mid-morning snacks are served each day and the school very much appreciates the nutritious
 snacks that parents provide. Snacks form a special connection between home and the
 classroom.
 ESNS shares parents’ concerns about healthy food options and the need to avoid snacks with
 excess sugar, fat, or salt. Fresh fruit, vegetables, crackers, cheese, and muffins are preferable to
 cupcakes and cookies. Water is served with each snack.
 The director will communicate any food allergies at the beginning of the school year. Parents are
 asked to try to accommodate these allergies in snack selection and send enough snacks to feed
 all of the children in the classroom.
 Please sign up to bring snacks on the calendar or through the Class Dojo.
 
 Birthday Celebrations
 Birthdays are special occasions here at ESNS. The birthday child is the snack provider for the
 class on their special day. Small cupcakes or cookies can serve to mark the occasion. Half
 birthdays are celebrated for those with summer birthdays. Teachers will consult with parents if
 a birthday falls on the weekend or over a school break.
 Please do not send goodie bags, balloons or candy. We keep it simple here at ESNS.
 Sometimes a student’s family will donate a book to ESNS’s library to commemorate their
 birthday. Should you wish to do so, teachers can help with book suggestions or whether we
 already have your child’s favorite in our library. Parents are welcome to visit the classroom and
 read a birthday book. Please consult with your child’s teacher to determine the best time of day
 for a book reading.
 
 6
 Holiday Celebrations
 Celebrations are a vital part of our culture and ESNS children enjoy special activities for
 birthdays and many holidays: Halloween, Thanksgiving Day, Martin Luther King Day, Valentine’s
 Day, Presidents’ Day, and the Fourth of July. Children make gifts as a means of sharing and
 “taking care of” someone else. Most of these holidays fit into our “taking care of” model which
 encourages acceptance and understanding of different backgrounds, religions, and cultures.
 ESNS holds a simple Holiday Party before winter break with singing and food to share.
 
 ESNS Community Gatherings
 
 Several social gatherings are scheduled during the school year including a Back to School/Open
 House for families and teachers in October and monthly Picnic on the Playground when the
 weather is nice. Younger children are invited. Other community events including a Movie Night,
 Grandparents Day, the Spring Carnival, and the Art Gallery Opening serve to bring families
 together, strengthen classroom friendships, and put faces to names.
 
 Historically, at the end of the school day, families have allowed their children to play on school
 grounds. We love that students and families want to spend more time at our school and we
 want to do so safely while respecting the wishes of The Ethical Society. Families are encouraged
 to choose play areas that are safe and in the north part of the grounds away from traffic and
 stained glass windows. The Ethical Woods at the bottom of the parking lot is an excellent
 choice.
 
 Parent-Teacher Conferences
 
 Parent-teacher conferences are scheduled twice each year, in the fall and spring.
 In addition, a conference can be held at any time, initiated by parents or teachers to discuss a
 common concern or to share news affecting the life of the student.
 Parents and teachers may also exchange information by email, phone, or through our sharing
 platform Class Dojo. Parents are also encouraged to email or message teachers to arrange a
 time to discuss their child. To ensure privacy, it is best to avoid discussing concerns in the
 classroom when children or other parents are present.
 
 Resource Library
 ESNS has a parent resource library in the bookshelf outside the preschool door. This includes
 books on parenting and child development, pamphlets and flyers from elementary school
 programs, and special classes or events. We will also post articles or information about child
 centered events in our area on Class DoJo.
 Please feel welcome to borrow books and materials any time.
 
 7
 Fundraising Activities
 
 Fundraising projects provide necessary support to the ESNS budget. We typically have a Fall
 Fundraiser Event that has included past activities such as a wine-tasting and a silent auction.
 In the spring, our child-centered carnival provides a community building event for our families.
 These events usually include auctions, raffles, and much more.
 Parent support in the organization and success of these fundraisers is tremendously appreciated
 and could not happen without your effort.
 
 The Ellen Schapiro Scholarship Fund
 We solicit funds that are used as tuition assistance for families who might otherwise be unable
 to afford our program. Named for our beloved former director, all donations are tax deductible.
 When children practice positive social skills and start to build their “intellectual scaffolding,”
 they are more likely to succeed in meeting behavioral expectations in kindergarten and beyond.
 ESNS helps construct an academic foundation and a love for learning by supporting children’s
 natural curiosity in an age appropriate manner. All children can benefit from this style of
 preschool programming and The Ellen Schapiro Scholarship Fund ensures that everyone can.
 
  School Policies and Procedures
 
 Tuition
 
 Tuition is billed monthly through our Quickbooks accounting program. You will receive an email
 invoice at the first of the month that is due upon receipt. Parents may pay on a semester,
 monthly or annual payment plan. Charges for Extended Day are also billed monthly. Please
 discuss payment options with the director. Payments can be made on-line with debit cards. We
 also accept cash and checks made out to The Ethical Society Nursery School.
 
 Withdrawal Policy
 
 ESNS has many ongoing expenses such as teacher salaries, rent, and custodial fees. As per your
 enrollment agreement letter, it should be understood that enrollment is a commitment for the
 entire academic year. No reduction or remission of fees can be allowed in the event of a child’s
 withdrawal from school.
 
 Immunizations
 
 State law requires that every child enrolled in a nursery school, preschool, or day care center
 must be adequately immunized according to the REMOVEDouri Immunization Schedule. This schedule
 is in compliance with the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, Centers for Disease
 Control and Prevention, The AmREMOVEDn Academy of Pediatrics, and The AmREMOVEDn Academy of
 
 8
 Family Physicians. For more information about required immunizations
 visit:https://health.mo.gov/living/wellness/immunizations/schoolrequirements.php
 Each parent must provide satisfactory evidence of required immunizations to the director who,
 in turn, must file an annual report of compliance. Your child’s pediatrician provides a report of
 vaccinations to you at each visit, and a copy of this form is adequate evidence of vaccination.
 Immunization information, signed by the child's doctor (by hand or electronically), must be on
 file in the Nursery School office before a child is allowed to enter school.
 The Ethical Society Nursery School Board will review cases of necessary medical exemptions and
 will potentially allow an unvaccinated child to attend school. Any other exemption to
 vaccinations is not allowed.
 Children who are on a delayed immunization schedule are required to submit the REMOVEDouri
 Department of Health “Immunizations in Progress” form with their immunization record. The
 Board will then review the child’s record and decide on eligibility to continue. (see statute
 below)
 
 Immunization in progress. Section 167.181, RSMo, provides that students may continue to
 attend school as long as they have started an immunization series and provide satisfactory
 evidence indicating progress is being accomplished. An original Department of Health and
 Senior Services’ form Imm.P.14 shall be completed and placed on file with the school
 immunization health record of each student with immunizations in progress. The Imm.P.14
 form is incorporated by reference in this rule as published June 2012 by the Department of
 Health and Senior Services and may be obtained by contacting a medical provider, local public
 health agency, or the department’s Bureau of Immunization Assessment and Assurance at PO
 Box 570, Jefferson City, MO 65102-0570, or by calling 800-219-3224. This rule does not
 incorporate any subsequent amendments or additions. Failure to meet the next scheduled
 
 9
 appointment constitutes noncompliance with the school immunization law and exclusion shall
 be initiated immediately.
 
 Immunization Policy approved by ESNS Board 12/5/2018
 
 Discipline/Setting Limits
 ESNS follows an umbrella policy on discipline. Each class models the “taking care of” goals for
 working in a community.
 “Taking care of ourselves; taking care of each other; taking care of our community.”
 Taking care of ourselves covers everything from washing our hands before we eat to verbally
 expressing our desire for someone else’s toy with polite words. Taking care of each other
 involves watching our own body in space so we don’t bump into or knock over anyone else to
 taking turns on the slide so everyone gets to play. We take care of our community by recycling,
 cleaning up after ourselves, and treating our community toys gently.
 Our teachers have years of experience in anticipating outbursts or unhealthy peer interactions.
 In most cases, we can stop or redirect behavior before something negative occurs. If not,
 teachers will first consult with the injured party to make sure they are emotionally and
 physically okay. Then, they will turn their attention to the child who might need more support in
 “taking care of our friends” or, more likely, “taking care of ourselves” in a positive manner.
 Reflection over what has occurred will lead to discovering other behavior options, usually an
 apology and finally a do-over. Modeling healthy peer interactions is what we do best, every day.
 Setting reasonable limits for children is predicated on ESNS’s deeply held beliefs:
  ● Children need predictable limits so they can behave freely and responsibly within secure
  boundaries.
  ● Limits are set to ensure the safety of all children.
  ● No child may hurt another child nor will the teachers allow this to occur.
  ● Under no circumstances will physical force or punishment be used on any child.
 Procedures:
  ● Positive reinforcement.
  ● Anticipating unhealthy social interactions.
  ● Redirection. Encouraging positive, healthy, and inclusive social activities.
  ● Expressing disappointment or disapproval in a respectful and constructive manner.
  ● Simple, logical, and immediate consequences.
 
 If you have any questions about this policy of setting limits and “taking care of each other,”
 please speak with the director.

 We are a half-day kindergarten only program. We are not a full scale daycare
 program, therefore we do not offer care for children under five.

199b9d7e4a13a118,"Good morning,
 We do have space available in some of our programs. Were you interested in our
 school day or half day program? Did you have a location in mind? Please see our
 website for more information. The first step would be to request registration.
 Once we receive the registration we will reach out and let you know if we have
 availability for what is requested. Generally as long as all of the requirements
 are met, your child can begin in the program in 2 weeks.

199b14c8293b34aa,"I am out of office, and would need to look at roster and wait-list to be able to
 answer if and when I would have a spot available, but will look first thing
 Monday morning and let you know!
 First a little about our school, we open at 7:30 AM and close at 4:00 PM, we
 offer an after school program to parents that is an extra $50.00 a week and is
 from 4:00 to 6:00 PM. We are an Early Intervention Day Treatment Facility that
 offers Speech, Physical, and Occupational Therapies at the school! We have a
 developmental specialist to aide staff in correct developmental practices in our
 classrooms. Do you have concerns with your childs development? For example, any
 concerns with speech? How does he/she run, climb, jump? Does she/he have
 Medicaid A? If so you can contact your childs PCP and ask them to perform a
 developmental screener for a possible delay. If the PCP says yes they have a
 possible delay, then you can have a referral for developmental, speech,
 occupational, and physical evaluations to see if they might qualify for therapy
 and if so then Medicaid will pay for your childs attendance.
 We also accept private pay and for her age group we charge $110.00 a week, with
 an $85.00, one time enrollment fee, and payment is due the week before she
 attends.
 We provide breakfast, lunch and snack that meets the USDA federal meal time
 guidelines.
 Would be glad to step up a time for you and your REMOVED to come in and tour our
 facility just let me know what works best for you! And will let you know
 Monday, for sure about available spots.

 Thank you for inquiring! I have space for a 3 year old. My hours are 7:30-5:15

 the CCFP food program and I provide breakfast, lunch and pm snack plus all

 preschool and a teacher that comes once a week to go over the packets. We have a
 large outside space and many, many developmentally appropriate toys. We go to
 the library (weather permitting) and the park weekly.
 My prices are $1100 per month, I only provide full time care. Please let me know

199b0d4d20320c3a,"Hello, thanks for reaching out. I have availability as soon as Tuesday, October
 14. I could schedule a walk-through Monday at 3:30 PM if you would like. That is
 the only day/time I have available next week. As I am going on vacation. If you
 are interested in that, let me know and you fill out the information below!
 Hi, and thank you for your interest in Baby Steps ChildCare LLC. My address is
 1705 N Charlotte St, Appleton, WI 54911. My hours of operation are 7:30 AM to
 4:30 PM, Monday-Friday. Because I am fully licensed, my first aid and CPR
 certifications are up-to-date. I am not open on weekends. For you to secure a
 spot for your child, a walkthrough interview needs to occur. I am interviewing
 you as much as you are interviewing me during this time. My priority is the
 students I already have enrolled, so if I don’t think it’s a good fit, I will
 let you know. I do not offer sibling discounts because this is a licensed
 in-home daycare and my spots are limited. I require the first week’s rate to be
 paid upfront to secure a place. That is nonrefundable. Additionally, the annual
 registration fee of $125 needs to be paid. This fee is per child. This must be
 two weeks from the tour date and is non-refundable. Payment is accepted via
 cashier's check, state assistance, or the Brightwheel app. This is a
 comprehensive in-app. You get updates about what your kiddo eats, when they eat,
 when they go to the bathroom, etc. This app can collect payments. It’s very
 convenient for tax time as everything is in one place, in a printable form.
 
 I do accept state subsidies (Wisconsin shares). However, if you are in the
 process of getting approved for state subsidy, that can be a very lengthy
 process. I have seen it take up to 3 months to get approved. All fees must be
 paid on time and in full while you’re waiting to get approved for subsidy. I
 offer walk-throughs from 3:30 pm-4:30 pm, Monday through Friday. I do not offer
 after-hours or weekend times for walk-throughs. I provide all food, and I am
 part of a federal food program that follows strict regulations for nutrition. I
 teach a curriculum from Funshine and make my individualized learning plans to
 meet the child’s specific needs. One important thing I’d like to say is that I
 am a daycare that is fully licensed, and this is my business. Think of a
 “normal” daycare but just in a house. I am a teacher who has extensive training,
 and I have a degree in early childhood education. I am not a babysitter. The
 children enrolled with me are my highest priority, and their safety and
 education are my job. At the bottom of this email, you will find a local
 resource that helps guardians pay for daycare depoists, plus my add on
 Care.com. Please note that I do not allow any electronic devices like phones or
 tablets (for child entertainment )to be brought at any time. If you are
 interested, please send me the following BEFORE REQUESTING A WALK THROUGH:
 
 · Child's full legal name
 
 · Date you are looking for care to start (this needs to be specific)
 
 · Times that drop off and pick up will happen.
 
 · All parents or guardians' full legal name(s)
 
 · Child's DOB:
 
 · Child's gender:
 
 · Address:
 
 · Best phone number(s) and email address(s) to reach both parents (if
 applicable):
 
 · Allergies or special diets (I have 2 dogs and one cat and we are NOT a
 nut-free household. If you have allergies to certain perfumes or scents this
 daycare will not work for you. ):
 
 · Behavioral issues (if applicable):
 
 · Educational goals you have for the child:
 
 · Does your child nap? If so, what times are they normally napping and for how
 long?:
 
 · Does your child drink breastmilk or formula or both? (if applicable):
 
 · Date and time you are hoping to do a walkthrough (this needs to be
 confirmed):
 
 · ANY medical issues? (This could even be as simple as a recurring diaper rash,
 etc.):
 
 · Is your child considered special needs?:
 
  * Has your child attended daycare before? Name of center?:
 Are you paying yourself or with a subsidy?:
 
 · Anything additional you would like to share with me?

199c4eae471c73cf,"Hi REMOVED,
 Unfortunately, our childcare center is currently full and we are not adding to
 our wait list at this time. We have such a long list that I don't feel it's
 right to keep adding to it. With a very low turnover rate, the list doesn't
 really move. I know that finding quality child care right now is a huge
 struggle for parents and I appreciate you reaching out to my center.
 Not to defer you from Bear Lake but I would suggest trying Leaps and Bounds in
 Onekama . They are larger and can accommodate more toddlers/preschoolers. They
 operate a very similar program as ours, being located within a school district,
 and are the next closest center.
 If you are interested, I can add you to our waitlist for our preschool program
 for the 26/27 school year?
 Let me know if you have any further questions.
 Thank you

 Thanks for your interest in our program! I'm sorry to say we aren't likely to
 have an opening until at least next September, and more likely September of
 2027. We have a full class right now with several younger siblings waiting for
 next year's spots. I'm happy to add you to our waitlist and keep you posted if
 anything changes!
 Depending on where in town you are, I always recommend families check out
 Neighborhood Childcare Center on the Westside, Cabrillo's lab preschool in

199c0ba1aff022ec,"Hello, I am so sorry your daycare closed down, seems like a lot are closing down
 and quickly.
 I have 1 spot that came available to start as early as 10/14. I’m open from
 7:30-5:30 and provide all food and milk with lunch. Nap time is between 12-3pm.
 Drop off is between 7:30-9am and pick ups are between 3-5:30pm. We do many
 activities in the morning and even go to the park that’s next door while our
 back yard is getting new fencing and grass. I do have dogs but they don’t
 interact with the kids (Basset Hounds sleep all day) and my old cats just stay
 away.
 The kids have cubbies that hold extra clothes, diapers and their nap blanket.
 I’ll let you know when I need anything with plenty of notice. I do help with
 potty training as long as parents have started at home first.
 How did you hear about my daycare?

199a082f65a25fc2,"Hello REMOVED,
 Thanks for your interest in Blue Oak Creative Schoolhouse. We are sorry to hear
 you are having an unanticipated search for childcare. We know how anxious a
 process that can be. We are a year-round full-day preschool program, with our
 school year beginning in August. While our school year is already underway, we
 have two spaces available for immediate enrollment.
 We would love to have you join us for a tour to see if our school may be a good
 fit for your family. Touring is the first step in our application process, and
 we do require both/all custodial parents to attend a tour before we can proceed
 with enrolling a child. We typically offer tours on a monthly basis, rotating
 location. Since all of our campuses share the same teaching philosophy and
 approach, we do not require parents to tour their preferred location in order to
 apply. Tours are for adults only, and parents are welcome to tour on separate
 dates if need be; we will provide the application after the first parent
 completes the tour. We actually have a tour TODAY at 10 am at our Washington
 Campus since we are trying to fill the two available spaces as soon as possible.
 If you are able to join, please let me know so we can plan accordingly.
 Otherwise, you can register for another tour or join our tour interest list to
 be notified when more tour dates are added via the link below.
 
 Blue Oak Tour Registration Form
 
 Please note that if you attend a tour, but wish to see another campus in person,
 we do not offer private walk-throughs or tours; however, we welcome you to
 register and come at the beginning of the next tour at that campus to see the
 physical space (you do not need to stay for the duration of the tour if you have
 already completed one).
 
 Please feel free to reach out with any additional questions. Otherwise, we hope
 to meet you in the near future.
 
 Best wishes,
 Siobhan

  Hello,
 
  I realize this is short notice. Our daycare just closed unexpectedly, and we
  are looking for childcare options for our three year old. When might a spot
  open up? Also, can we schedule an appointment with you to discuss?
 
  My REMOVED REMOVED and I look forward to hearing from you.
 
  Thanks,
